 WELCOME TO THE RENTING BOOK 
WHAT IS THE RENTING BOOK?  
The Renting Book is a guide to rental laws in the ACT . It is primarily written for tenants, to 
explain their legal rights and responsibilities.  It may also help landlords and real estate  
agents to make sure that propert ies are managed in accordance with the law.   
Rental laws in the ACT are set out in t he Residential Tenancies Act 1997  (the Act ) and the 
Residential Tenancies Regulation 1998  (the Regulation ). The Act  applies to properties 
rented from private landlords (whether or not through a  real estate  agent) as well as to public 
housing rented from the Government  and other forms of social and affordable housing  
provide d by community housing providers . The Act aims to ensure that (among other things) 
people renting in the ACT have stable and secure housing and are protected from unfair 
practices.  
The Act requires landlords to provide a copy of th is Renting  Book to tenant s (or tell 
their tenant where it can be obtained) before the tenancy starts.   
The Renting B ook covers the main  issues that may arise before, during and after a tenancy.  
It is a guide only.  It does not cover every aspect of the Act or every situation.  The Act 
is also amended from time to time.  You should always read your tenancy  agreement closely, 
check the Act and  seek legal advice  if you are unsure about your rights or obligations.   
IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU?  
The guidance in th e Renting Book applies where a property (or a room in a property) is 
rented under a residential tenancy agreement  (often referr ed to as a lease) . If you are paying 
rent for your home, you will usually have a residential tenancy agreement, but there are a 
few exceptions.  
This information is not for occupants  
Agreements to live in a  caravan or mobile home in a mobile home park, student 
accommodation  on a university  campus  or other  educational institution , crisis 
accommodation , agreements to occupy a premises because of a membership in  a club or 
other entity, accommodation in a boardi ng house, will usually be occupancy agreements . 
The law that applies to occupancy agreements is different and so  the guidance in this 
Renting Book will not  apply.  
If you have  an occupancy agreement  (or if you are unsure what type of agreement you 
have) , you can contact  these services for free and confidential advice :  
 the Tenancy Advice Service ACT  on 1300 402 512  or TAS@legalaidact.org.au , or 
 Canberra Community Law  on (02) 6218 79 00 or info@canberracommunitylaw.org.au  
Canberra Community Law can provide advice to occupants in crisis accommodation, 
residential parks (long -stay caravan parks) or social housing (including social housing 
provided by community housing providers).   8 
  
The Act (and this Renting Book) also does not apply to retirement villages, most universi ty 
student accommodation, aged care accommodation , or short -term holiday accommodation 
(e.g. through platforms like AirBnB).   
If you wish to seek advice in relation to these other types of accommodation, you can 
contact the Legal Aid general helpline on 1300 654 314  or visit 
https://www.legalaidact.org.au/what -we-do/legal -aid-helpline .  
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PUBLIC HOUSING 
TENANCIES  
The ACT Government, through Housing ACT, provides public housing to those in greatest 
need, including people who are experiencing homelessness, escaping domestic and family 
violence, in unhealthy and inappropriate living conditions, and where housing costs are 
unaffordable.  
The guidance in the Renting Book applies to public housing tenancies. However, there are 
some additional rules around the way public housing tenancies may be ended, that are not 
covered in this Book.  
Occasionally there are reasons Housing ACT mi ght need to end a tenancy agreement with a 
public housing tenant. Usually this is to facilitate an existing tenant to move from one public 
housing dwelling to another. However, it may also include ending the tenancy of a tenant 
who is no longer eligible fo r public housing. The waiting list for public housing is long. 
Housing ACT needs to be able to end tenancies in some circumstances, to make sure the 
public housing program operates effectively and public housing properties are made 
available to those most in need.  
ACT tenancy laws changed on 1 April 2023.  In particular, ‘no cause’ evictions were removed 
from tenancy law.  Limited new grounds to end public housing tenancies  were introduced,  to 
facilitate the effective management of the public housing program . The Renting Book does 
not cover these new grounds. Further guidance will be made publicly available in this renting 
book soon.  In the interim, if you are a tenant in public housing and you receive a notice to 
vacate you may wish to seek legal advice .

  ESSENTIALS FOR TENANTS  
 Read your residential tenancy agreement and check what terms it contains  before you 
sign it.  Check that it contains the standard residential tenancy terms and whether it 
contains any additional terms.  
 Do not sign anything unless you understand  what it means.  Never sign a blank form 
even if it looks official.  Keep a copy of everything you sign .  
 Read  the condition report  for the property  and make sure you  sign it and send it back . If 
you don’t do this , you will be taken to accept it.  You have the right to disagree with it and 
add your comments to  the report. Consider taking photos of the property on , or soon 
after, the day you move in  as evidence of its condition . You may wish to send your 
photos to your landlord along with the completed condition report.  
 Put all requests to your agent or landlord in writing . If important matters are discussed or 
agreed in a conversation, follow up with an email to confirm your understanding of the 
conversation.  Having a written record will help if there is a dispute  at a later stage.  
 Let your landlord or agent know as soon as possible of any repairs  that need to be done.  
 If you are in a share house , get written permission from your landlord  and fellow 
co-tenant(s)  if you want to move out  or have a new housemate  move in as a co -tenant .  
 Get written permission from your landlord if you want  to sublet the property  to someone 
else. You are not allowed to have new people (other than a domestic partner , children  or 
short -term, non -paying guests ) living in the property without the landlord’s consent.  
 Make sure you pay your rent  on time . You are not allowed to withhold rent during a 
dispute with your landlord unless you have the approval of the ACT Civil and 
Administrative Tribunal ( ACAT ). 
 You cannot be evicted in the ACT witho ut your landlord giving you a valid reason that is 
recognised under the law. Wanting to increase the rent is not an acceptable reason. See 
further below on  ending your tenancy . 
 You are always entitled to seek legal advice . The Tenan cy Advice Service ACT is funded 
by the ACT Government to provide free legal advice to all tenants . You can  contact them 
on 1300 402 512 or TAS@legalaidact.org.au . Other information and support services are 
listed in the ‘ Need more help? ’ section at the end of this book.  
 Communicate with your landlord or agent and keep them informed of any problems that 
may arise. Most problems are resolved by agreement.  
 If a dispute between you and the landlord  (or agent) cannot be resolved, you have the 
right to  take the dispute to ACAT . You do not need a lawyer in ACAT . Application fees 
(and fee waiver processes) may apply . You can get further information on ACAT’s 
website  or contact ACAT on (02) 6207 1740 or tribunal@act.gov.au .   
 The law prohibits landl ords from retaliating against you (e.g. trying to evict you or putting 
you on a tenancy database (also known as a tenancy ‘blacklist’ ) or ending your tenancy) 
if you seek to enforce your rights.  If you think this has happened , see further below for 
more in formation on retaliatory evictions  and tenancy databases , or seek legal advic e.

leaving a tenancy while your fellow co -tenants remain in the property and continue the 
tenancy agreement.  See the section on bonds in share hous es for more information.    14 
 SEARCHING FOR A TENANCY  
There are some rules that apply before a tenancy even begins.  This includes rules  about 
how properties are advertised for rent and rules about how landlords and agents can behave 
when discussing the rent for a property  with a prospective tenant . This sectio n of the Renting 
Book discusses the se rules.  
RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS  
When a property is advertised for rent there are rules about what information the rental ad  
must contain and rules about what it must not contain . These rules are meant to make 
sure that you  have information to to decid e if the property is right for you.  
All ads for a rental property must : 
 Indicate the Energy Efficiency Rating  (EER) for the property , if the prope rty has  an 
EER rating  
❖ If there is no EER rating, the ad must say that there is no EER rating . 
 Indicate if the proposed tenancy agreement contains certain special conditions , 
including:  
❖ Any terms that are  inconsistent with the standard terms  (noting these must be 
endorsed by ACAT  to be valid ). 
❖ If the tenant will be required to seek the landlord’s consent before being able to 
keep a pet . 
 Indicate i f the premises are an adaptable housin g dwelling  (a premises  that is 
designed so that it can be easily modified to make it accessible for individuals with 
disabilities or progressive frailties ). 
 Indicate whether the premises comply with the ceiling insulation standard , or, if an 
exempt ion applies .  
 Indicate the rental rate  (i.e. the weekly rent) for the property.   
❖ Note: It is possible for the ad to indicate differe nt rental rates for the property if 
the rate depends on what is included with the property ( e.g. if the property is 
furnished / unfurnished or if the property comes with / without  a car space or 
storage area) . 
The person publishing the ad  commits an offenc e if they do  not include the required 
information  in the ad . See the section on penalties  for more information.  
When an ad for a rental property is published it must  not: 
 advertise the property withou t a rental rate , 
 advertise with a rent range (e .g., ‘$500 -$600/ week ’ or ‘$500 ono / week’ ) 
 advertise the property in a way that invites rent bidding (e.g., ‘by negotiation’ or ‘offers 
accepted’).  
 15 
 RENT BIDDING  
‘Rent bidding’ is where a person wanting to rent a property offers to pay more rent than the 
advertised amount.  
It is an offence for landlord s, agents or rental application databases  (e.g. apps)  to ask you to 
bid more than the advertised rental price for a prop erty. However, you can choose to offer to 
pay more for a property if you want to.  
If you voluntarily offer to a pay a higher an amount than the advertised rent, a landlord is 
allowed  to accept your offer . 
Remember that the landlord or agent may be constrained in what they can say to you as 
they are not allowed to encourage rental bids. For example, they should not proactively tell 
you that other tenants have made a higher bid on the property as this may be s een as 
encouraging you to make a higher offer .  
The scenarios below provide some examples of conversations that might happen and how 
rent bidding laws  would apply .  
Scenario 1  
A prospective tenant approaches a landlord or agent and says “I would like to of fer $10 per 
week above the advertised price for the property”.  
Landlord or agent responds:  “Thank you for that offer. I will pass it on to the landlord and it 
will be considered when assessing rental applications.”  
Comment: This response complies with ACT rent bidding laws as landlords are allowed to 
accept rent price offers made voluntarily by tenants.  
Scenario 2  
A prospective tenant asks if anyone has offered more than the advertised price for the 
property / more than an amount they have just offered.  
Landlord or agent responds:  Under ACT tenancy laws I am not allowed to encourage a 
person to offer more than the advertised rent. Answering that question may be considered to 
be encouraging a rental price offer. Under ACT laws tenants are not prevented fr om offering 
more than the advertised price if they do so voluntarily.  
Comment:  This response complies with ACT rent bidding laws as it states the law but does 
not encourage the tenant to offer a rent bid by informing them about other rental bids.  
Scenari o 3 
A prospective tenant asks a real estate agent or landlord “If I offer more rent, would I have a 
better chance of securing the property?”  
Landlord or agent responds:  Under ACT tenancy laws I am not allowed to encourage a 
person to offer more than the ad vertised rent for the property.  The law does not prevent 
tenants f rom volunteering to pay more.  Applications are judged on multiple factors and the 
rent is not the only criteria used when evaluating an application.  16 
 Comment:  This response complies with A CT rent bidding laws as it states the law but does 
not encourage the tenant to offer a rent bid.  
Scenario 4  
An applicant missed out on a rental property and asks why.  The landlord or agent informs 
the tenant that the successful applicant had offered a hi gher rent. The unsuccessful 
applicant is unhappy and asks “Why didn’t you tell me that someone else had made a higher 
offer?”  
Landlord or agent responds:  Under ACT tenancy laws tenants are able to offer more than 
the advertised price where they do so volun tarily.  However, I am not allowed to encourage a 
person to offer more than the advertised rent for the property.  Informing you about other 
offers in relation to a property may be considered to be an invitation to you to offer a higher 
amount so I was una ble to inform you of other rent offers.  
Comment:  This response complies with ACT rent bidding laws as it states the law and 
informs the tenant why they could not be advised of other rental bids.  
Scenario 5  
At a rental property inspection, the landlord or agent proactively informs each prospective 
tenant that tenants can offer amounts above the advertised price when making a rental 
application.  
Comment:  This conduct does not comply with ACT tenancy laws as by  proactively raising 
the question of rent bidding (without responding to a question or  offer voluntarily made by 
the tenant), the landlord or agent may be considered to be encouraging rental bids.  
Scenario 6  
A prospective tenant calls the landlord or age nt to ask about the progress of their application 
but does not offer to pay additional rent when inquiring about their application.  The landlord 
or agent replies: “Someone has made a higher offer on the property so the landlord is 
considering that applica tion first.”  
Comment:   This statement does not comply with ACT tenancy laws.  This is because 
proactively raising the question of rent bids (without responding to a question or an offer 
voluntarily made by the tenant), may be considered to be encouraging a rental bid.  
Scenario 7  
A landlord has several applications to choose from, one of which has offered to pay an 
additional $10 per week. The landlord asks the agent to go back to another applicant to see 
if they will match or offer more.  
Agent replies:  Under ACT tenancy laws tenants are able to offer more than the advertised 
price where they do so voluntarily.   However, I am not allowed to encourage a person to 
offer more than the advertised rent for the property.  
Comment:  This response complies  with ACT rent bidding laws as it states the law but the 
agent does not encourage a tenant to offer a higher rent.

 STARTING YOUR TENANCY  
This section of the Renting Book discusses the most important rules about how tenancies 
are started and issues you should consider before you sign  a residential tenancy agreement .  
KNOW YOUR AGREEMENT  
A residential tenancy agreement is often called a ‘lease’. It is a legally binding  contract that 
includes all the terms associated with the tenancy. The tenancy agree ment includes the 
Standard Residential Tenancy Terms  which are set rules that apply to all tenancies in the 
ACT. In certain circumstances the tenancy agreement may also include additional terms.  
As a tenant, you must comply with the terms of the tenancy agreement  (as must the 
landlord) .  
Read your agreement carefully so you know what is in the  agreement  before you  sign it. If 
you do not understand something in the agreement, ask the agent or landlord for 
clarification, or seek legal advice . You may wish to get clarification on any points that are 
impo rtant to you in writing from the landlord or agent.  
It is possible under the law for residential tenancy agreements to be verbal  (or partly written 
and partly verbal ). However, this is not common , and it is not advisable as it can give rise to 
confusion o r disputes. It can be difficult to prove what was agreed in a  spoken  conversation  
(unless it is recorded) . Anything agreed with your landlord at the time of entering a tenancy 
agreement should preferably be recorded in writing as part of the agreement.  
FIXED TERM OR PERIODIC  
Make sure you understand at the beginning of your tenancy whether you have a fixed term 
or periodic agreement.  
A fixed term agreement  specifies a particular period during which there will be less options  
for both you and the landlord to end the agreement . It is common in the ACT for residential 
tenancy agreements to start out as fixed term agreements for 6 or 12 months.  Fixed term 
agreements will automatically convert to a periodic tenancy at the end of t he fixed term 
(unless the tenant ends the agreement or the tenant agrees to enter a new fixed term 
agreement). Note: a landlord cannot end a tenancy agreement just because the fixed 
term is ending.  
Any residential tenancy agreement that does not specify a  fixed term is a periodic 
agreement.  Periodic tenancies are sometimes referred to colloquially as ‘ month -to-month’  
leases.   
Periodic tenancies continue indefinitely until one party brings it to an end . A tenant can 
end a periodic tenancy by giving 3 weeks ’ notice to their landlord. A landlord can also end a 
periodic tenancy for a range of reasons , including by giving notice to the tenant . The amount 
of notice will depend on the reason the landlord wants to end the tenancy. The required 
notice will usually be more than a month’s notice.  For example, if the landlord wants to move 18 
 in or sell the property they must give 8 weeks’ notice or if they want to undertake significant 
renovations they must give 12 weeks ’ notice.   
Whether your agreement is for a fixed t erm or periodic may affect your rights and 
responsibilities, especially around when the agreement can be ended . Generally speaking, it 
is easier for periodic agreements to be ended , which gives both you and the landlord more 
flexibility.  
A fixed term agreement will become a periodic agreement at the end of the  
fixed term  
A fixed  term tenancy does not automatically end at the end of a fixed term.  
If you do not give notice to your landlord that  you want to end the tenancy at the end of a 
fixed term , the tenancy will continue as a periodic tenancy. You do not have to give any 
notice  if you simply wish to remain in the property.  
Landlords are not permitted to end a tenancy simply because the fixed term has 
ended.  Landlords can only end a ten ancy in accordance with the grounds for ending a 
tenancy listed in your agreement or the Act (see the section on ending a tenancy for more 
details). Your landlord  cannot end a tenancy (regardless of whether it is fixed or periodic) 
without giving you a rea son for doing so.  
However, you should be aware that it is easier for both you and the landlord to end a 
tenancy when it is periodic (there are more termination grounds available to a landlord 
during a periodic tenancy). If you prefer to have the security of a fixed term tenancy, you can 
agree with your landlord to enter a new fixed term agreement  at the end of an existing fixed 
term agreement . However, you do not have to do this if you do not want to .  
An example  of a fixed -term agreement converti ng to a periodic tenancy is as follows : 
 You find a rental property  and you sign a residential tenancy agreement with the landlord 
that states that the term of the agreement is from 1  July 2023 until 30 June 2024. You 
have a fixed term agreement.  
 By 30 June 2024, you have not entered into a new fixed term tenancy agreement , but 
you remain in the property. On 1 July 2024, you have a periodic agreement .  
 Your periodic agreement will continue until you or the landlo rd terminate it, or you enter 
into a new fixed term agreement with the landlord . 
WHAT  STANDARD TERMS  DOES THE AGREEMENT 
INCLUDE ? 
There are  Standard Residential Tenancy Terms  (Standard Terms ), which , by law , form part 
of all tenancy agreements in the ACT . There are some  Standard Terms that apply to all 
tenancies whilst other Standard Terms only apply to some tenancies. Many of the rules 
described in the Renting Book come from the Standard Terms.   This section describes which  
Standard Terms will be included in your agreement. Before you sign your agreement, pay 
attention to which  Standard Terms  your agreement includes . 19 
 Standard Terms that apply  to all ten ancy agreements  
The Standard Terms are the ba sic terms of a tenancy agreement.  The Standard Terms in 
Schedule 1 of the Act apply to all tenancy agreements in the ACT and are at Attachment 1 to 
this Book . They are intended  to provide protections for both landlords and tenants that 
cannot readily be contracted out of  (so tena nts don’t feel pressured to give up rights in order 
to get a tenancy) .   
It is possible for a tenancy agreement to include additional terms to the Stand ard Terms.  
Generally speaking, any additional terms must be consistent with the Standard Terms . 
However, there is a process  to include terms that are inconsistent with the Standard T erms  
where both parties agree to the terms and they are endorsed by ACAT. Unless inconsistent 
terms are endorsed, they will not be en forceable. There are also some terms that cannot be 
added  to a tena ncy agreement, even where the parties agree to them. These are discussed 
further below.   
Standard Terms that apply in  certain circumstances only  
There are certain standard terms that will only apply to some tenancy agreements. These 
additional standard terms are contained in Schedule 2 of the Act and are at Attachment 2  to 
this Book. Whether your agreement contains any of the se additional Standard Terms may 
depend on : 
 whether you have agreed to the additional standard term being included in your 
agreement ; or  
 whether your agreement is for community housing or subsidised accommodation.  
The additional Standard Terms will only be included in your agreement in the circumstances  
described below .  
Additional Standard Terms that can be included  by agreement  
A residen tial tenancy agreement can include additional  Standard T erms  where  you and the 
landlord  agree on their inclusion.  
These additional Standard Terms include:  
 the ‘break lease fee clause’  (Standard Term 101) ; and  
 the ‘posting termination clause’  (Standard term 102) . 
Break lease fee clause  
If you have a fixed term agreement, check if it includes a ‘break lease fee clause’ .  
The break lease fee clause determines the fee that you must pay if you end a fixed term 
agreement early (other than for a reason permitted under the Act). The fee will be capped at 
between 4 to 6 weeks’ rent, depending  on how much of the term of your lease has expired. 
See further below the section on ‘Ending Your Tenancy’ for details on how the break lease 
fee clause works . 
You might wish to include a break lease clause if there is any chance you may not stay in 
your home for the full fixed term period.  20 
 If you leave  the property early , other than for a reason permitted under the Act , the 
landlord can make an application to ACAT for compensation.  The compensation will be 
to cover the loss of  rent to the date when your fixed term was due to end and the costs of 
finding a tenant to replace you.   
Your landlord is always under a duty to minimise any losses they may suffer (this is  
sometimes referred to as ‘mitigating’ loss). This means that if you break your lease, they 
must act to find replacement tenants as soon as possible. As soon as new tenants are found 
and start their tenancy, your liability to pay compensation to your landl ord will reduce by the 
amount that the new tenants pay in rent. If the new tenants pay the same or a higher amount 
of rent than you were paying, this will mean that your liability to pay compensation will end 
from the date that the new tenants’ agreement starts. If your landlord does not take steps to 
reduce their losses (e.g. by finding a new tenant) then you may be able to argue that your 
liability for compensation should be reduced.  
The posting termination clause  
If you have a fixed term agreement, check if it includes a ‘ posting termination clause .’ This 
clause allows either the tenant or the landlord to break a fixed term agreement without 
penalty if posting arrangements  for their work require them to do so.  
 The landlord  may break a fixed term agreement if they are posted to Canberra  during 
the fixed term.  
 The tenant  may break a fixed term agreement if they are posted away from  Canberra  
during the fixed term.  
The person  who wishes to rely on the clause must provide a minimum of 8 weeks’ notice to 
the other person before the agreement can be terminated, as well as evidence of their 
posting arrangements (e.g. a letter from their employer).  
You should:  
 Consider whether you r employment arrangements make it desirable for the posting 
termination clause  to be included in your agreement.  
 Be aware, if it is included, it may be exercised by the landlord to end your agreement 
early  and you may only have 8 weeks to find a new home . 
Additional Standard Terms that depend on the circumstances of your tenancy 
agreement  
There are some other Standard Terms that will apply to a tenancy agreement in certain 
circumstances.  These include:  
 the community housing provider te rmination clause  (Standard Term 103)  
 the subsidised accommodation clauses  (Standard Terms 108 – 112).  
These additional standard terms are designed to a ssist in the management of social and 
affordable housing programs offered by community housing providers.  They allow these 
accommodation providers to end a tenancy in  certain circumstances , such as where you are  
no longer eligible for the support you are receiving  or where the property owner requires 
their property back .  21 
 Note : It is possible that an agreement will contain several of the se additional  terms.  For 
example , an agreement could  include  both  the community housing provider termination 
clause and the subsidised accom modation clause   
Further information on when these Standard Terms will be included in an agreement is 
below.  
Community housing provider termination clause  
The community housing provider termination clause will be automatically included in a 
tenancy agreement if:  
 your landlord is a registered Community Housing Provider ( CHP ); and 
 the property is owned by another person; and  
  the CHP rents the property to you under an agreement with the owner.  
This could include community -based social or affordable housing programs where the 
property is owned by either Housing ACT or a private property owner. For more 
information ,refer to the  section on the community housing provider termination clause  in this 
Book.  
Subsidised accommodation clauses  
‘Subsidised accommodation’ is a term used to describe certain types of accommodation 
offered to eligible community members by non -Government accommodation providers. It is 
intended to  capture tenancies offered under the National Rental Affordability Scheme,  
tenancies offered under the ACT Government’s Community Affordable Housing program and 
other social and affordable housing tenancies offered by CHPs where the tenant pays less 
than the ‘market rate’ in rent. It may also capture accommodation programs offer ed by CHPs 
on their own initiative. These additional clauses are intended to support the operation of the 
community social and affordable housing program s and to ensure these types of tenancies 
can be made available to eligible community members . 
The subsidised accommodation clauses will automatically be included in your tenancy 
agreement where:  
 your landlord, or the organisation acting on behalf of your landlord is a CHP ; or 
 your landlord or the property owner receives Government funding or assistance  to 
provide the property to you.  
For more information ,refer to the section on subsidised accommoda tion in this Book.  
ANY TERMS IN ADDITION TO  THE STANDARD 
TERMS?  
Additional terms consistent  with the Standard Terms  
A residential tenancy agreement can include additional  terms to the Standard  Terms  where : 
  you and the landlord agree; and              
 the term is not inconsistent with the Standard Terms.  
Example s of additional term s that are not inconsistent with the Standard Terms include:  22 
  a term stating the amount of rent and the method for rental payments  (e.g., bank 
transfer, direct debit, credit card, cash, cheque, payment app etc.)  
 a term in a fixed t erm tenancy agreement that indicates the amount by which the rent will 
increase (or a method for calculating the rent increase) for each year of a multi -year fixed 
term tenancy ; or 
 a term indicating that the tenant must seek the landlord ’s consent  to have a pet at the 
rental property (so long as the requirement to seek consent was included in the 
advertis ement for the property – see the section on pets  below for more information) . 
Terms tha t are inconsistent with the Standard Terms (where endorsed by 
ACAT)  
A residential tenancy agreement can only include  a term that is inconsistent with the 
Standard Terms  if:  
 you and the landlord agree ; and              
 the term is endorsed by ACAT .  
Most agreements do not include endorsed inconsistent terms, although in  some  cases there 
might be good reason to do this.  
If your landlord proposes to include inconsistent terms in the agreement, these must be 
clearly marked or annotated in the agreement in a way to draw your attention to them.   If you 
agree to the term, you and your landlord must then make a joint application  to ACAT for the 
term to be endorsed.   
If an inconsistent term is not  endorsed  by ACAT , it will be  unenforceable , even if you 
have agreed to it by signing the lease .  
Some examples:  
 A landlord inserts a term into the agreement that says only one person can live in the 
property (e.g. a studio apartment) at any time. This term is inconsistent with clause 52 of 
the Standard Terms  which provides that a landlord must not cause or permit interference 
with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the tenant in the use by the tenant of 
the premises . It cannot be included unless you agree to it and it is endorsed by ACAT.  
 A landlord  inserts a term into the agreement that says that the landlord may conduct 
inspections at any time and without notice. This term is inconsistent with the Standard 
Terms. It cannot be included unless you agree to it and it is endorsed by ACAT.  
Terms that ca nnot be added  
A residential tenancy agreement cannot include a term that is inconsistent with the Act  
(other than the Standard Terms). A CAT cannot endorse such terms. Such terms are 
unenforceable , even if the tenant and landlord agree to include them.  This is because 
the law is designed to  protect tenants by making sure that landlords cannot try to ‘contract 
out’ of the  basic minimum protections in the Act.   
 23 
 Example:  
 A landlord inserts a term in the agreement requiring the payment of extra bond because 
you have a pet. Th is term is inconsistent with the Act. It cannot be included (and cannot 
be endorsed by ACAT).   
 A landlord inserts a term in the agreement which allows them to increase the rent in a 
periodic tenancy with just 1 weeks’ notice. This  term is inconsistent with the Act which 
requires that the tenant be given 8 weeks’ notice of a rent increase. It cannot be included 
(and cannot be endorsed by ACAT).  
 
UNITS  – OWNERS CORPORATION RULES  
If your new home is a unit or apartment it will have a n owners corporation  (sometimes 
referred to as the ‘body corporate’) that has rules about how the building will operate.  The 
rules will cover such things as use of common space in the apartment building . The landlord 
or agent is required to give you a cop y of the oweners corporat ion rules at the start of your 
tenancy. Owners corporation rules are sometimes referred to as ‘strata rules ’.   
You must comply with the  owners corporation  rules (and any notices given to you by the 
owners corporation under the rules), unless the rules are inconsistent with the Standard 
Terms.  
An example  of an inconsistent term : 
 A landlord provides a copy of the owners corporation’s rules. The rules say that tenants 
are not permitted to have visitors stay overnight. This rule is inconsistent with clause 52 
of the Standard Terms,  which entitles tenants to use the property without interference,  
and so tenants would not be required to comply with it.  
However , if the owners corporation rules include rules about pets you must comply with 
them. These owners corporation rules must be reasonable and they are regulated by the 
Unit Titles (Management) Act 2 011. 
If you think the owners corporation rules for your new home  are inconsistent with the 
Standard  Terms, you should raise  this with your landlord or agent, and you may wish to seek 
legal advice.   
If you breach a rule of the owners corporation, you may be issued with a rule infringement 
notice by the owners corporation. This notice will outline what the breach is and what you 
must do to remedy the b reach.  You may dispute the rule infr ingement notice if you believe 
you have not com mitted a breach of the rule.  However, if you fail to comply with a rule 
infringement notice, the owners corporation can pursue the matter further through ACAT, 
where an or der or penalties may be applied.  
 24 
 UTILITIES  AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY  
Energy Efficiency  
When advertising properties for rent, landlords or real estate agents must  state in the 
advertisement whether the property has an existing energy efficiency rating (‘EER’) . 
Properties with higher EERs should be more energy efficient and save you money on your 
energy bills.  There are separate rules (including advertising rules) in relation to minimum 
housing standards  (which require the property to have ceiling insulation to  a certain 
standard)  – see the section s on advertising requirements  and minimum housing standards 
for more information.  
If the property you are going to rent has a current EER, the landlord or agent must give you 
a copy of the EER statement before your tenancy begins . For tips on how to make your 
rental home more energy -efficient, and save money on your bills, see 
https://www.ac tsmart.act.gov.au/ . 
The ACT Government’s  Renter’s Home Energy Program  can help with draug ht-proofing and 
other energy efficiency measures for your home. The program provides an online home 
energy assessment tool as well as free and tailored advice for renters either in -person, over 
the phone or via email.  
Low-income households can access help to draught -proof their home through the Low-
Income household progra m currently delivered by St Vincent de Paul.  
Utilities  
Make sure you are clear at the outset which bills you will need to pay for the property. 
Generally:  
 You are responsible for  paying all utilities bills where the account is in your name. For 
example, i f the gas , electricity , phone  or internet bill is in your name , you are responsible 
for the charges.  
 For water bills,  
❖ the landlord  is responsible for the supply charge , and  
❖ the tenant  is responsible for consumption charges  (the bill s will itemise supply 
and consumption separately).   If you are not provide d a copy of the water bill you 
can ask for it so that you can check if what you are being asked to pay is correct .  
A landlord cannot  make you pay for service s for which there is not a separate metering 
device  for the property . For example, if there is no water meter for each apartment  in an 
apartment building  or a granny flat behind a main residence , or if the property is a share 
house with different tenancy agreements covering different parts of the house, the tenant 
cannot be  required to pay water consumption charges  as there is no way of accurately 
measuring their inidivdual consumption . Where the utilities are not sep arately metered, t he 
landlord is responsible for that cost.  
Landlords are responsible for all rates and taxes  associated with the property  as well as 
owners corporation levies and fees  (if applicable).  25 
 A note for landlords : 
 ACT law requires landlords to pay land tax on rented properties that are not their 
principal place of residence. Landlords must tell the Commissioner for ACT Revenue if 
they start renting out a residential property as generally it will be liable for land tax.  High 
penalties may apply if a landlord fails to notify the Commissioner of the rental property. 
Further information about land tax is available at: https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/land -
tax. 
PETS  
If you are a tenant currently living in a rental property and you want to get a pet, see the 
information on pets in the ‘During Your Tenancy’ section bel ow. 
I am looking for a rental property and I have a pet (or I want to get a pet). How 
do I make sure I will be allowed to keep my pet?  
Landlords are not permitted to include terms in residential tenancy agreements that 
prohibit pets outright. However, land lords can require you to ask for their consent to 
have a pet , as long as this is done within the rules set out below . 
If the landlord require s you to ask for their consent to have a pet, they must state this in the 
advertisement for the rental property. It  is an offence  for the landlord not to do this.  
If the advertisement for a rental property does not say anything about pets, this mean s that 
you are allowed to have a pet.  
This advertising requirement is intended to help prospective tenants decide whether to 
inspect or apply for a property and to allow them to start a conversation with the landlord or 
real estate agent about their pet.  
You are not obliged to disclose that yo u have a pet during the application process for a 
property.  However, if you are interested in a property that does not permit pets without the 
landlord’s consent, think carefully about how you will obtain consent before you sign 
the residential tenancy agr eement. You will not be permitted to keep a pet on the 
property without the landlord’s consent  if they have followed the process below .   
Can the landlord refuse consent for my pet?  
Landlords are not permitted to refuse consent for pets unless they have th e approval 
of ACAT.   
This is intended to be a case -by-case process, where ACAT will consider the circumstances 
of the tenant and landlord, the nature of the property and the type of pet. If necessary, the 
ACAT process  can happen before you sign the residen tial tenancy agreement (as 
prospective tenants and prospective landlords are able to bring matters before ACAT under 
the Act).  
The information in the pets section in the ‘During Your Tenancy’ chapter below contains more 
detail on how the ACAT process works.  26 
 Can the landlord put conditions on their consent?  
A landlord may grant consent for the pet while imposing reasonable conditions about how 
many pets you are allowed to keep on the property, or the cleaning and maintenance of the 
property. ACAT’s approval is not required for  reasonable  conditions to be imposed.  
Do I have to pay more bond or agree to more inspections because of my pet?  
A landlord cannot  require you to pay extra bond o r insist on  additional inspections because 
you have a pet.  
I am looking to rent a unit. Are the rules on pets different?  
If you are looking to rent in an apartment building, you and your landlord must comply with 
the rules under rental laws as well as  unit title  laws and owners corporation rules that apply 
to keeping pets . See the information on  pets in  unit titled properties  section of  the ‘During 
Your Tenancy’  chapter .  
I have a disability and I have an assistance animal. Will my animal be 
allowed?  
Discrimination law  in the ACT (the Discrimination Act 1991 ) prohibit s landlords from 
discrim inating against a tenant who has a disability, which includes their reliance on an 
assistance animal. This means that landlords cannot refus e an application for a rental 
property  from a person with a disability  because of their assistance animal.  A landlor d might 
ask for evidence (e.g. a letter from a health practitioner) confirming the need for the animal.  
The same applies to owners co rporations in unit titled properties.  
BOND  
How much?  
A landlord or real estate agent is not permitted to ask for or accept more than 4 weeks ’ rent 
as a bond . They cannot ask you to ‘top up’ or increase the bond in any way . 
Some examples:  
 Tenants cannot be asked to pay more than one bond. If you enter into successive 
agreements with the same landlord for the same property, the original bond remains 
valid.  
 Tenants cannot be asked for extra bond money for any reason e.g. as a condition of 
consent to keep a pet.  27 
 Lodging the bond  
The bond must be lodged with the ACT Revenue Office (which is part o f the 
ACT Government).  You need to agree with the landlord on whose  responsibility  it is to lodge  
the bond.   
The usual practice is for the  landlord  or real estate agent to  lodge  the bond .  
 Landlords or agents can lodge bonds online using the Rental Bonds Portal on the 
ACT Revenue Office website (rather than filling in and submitting a bond lodgement 
form)  or by filling in a web form . 
 It is an offence  for landlords or agents  to keep the  bond and not lodge it.   
 A private landlord  must lodge the bond within two weeks  of receiving it , or within two 
weeks of  the start of the tenancy (whichever is later).  
 An agent  must lodge the bond within 4 weeks  of receiving it, or within 4 weeks of the 
start of the tenancy (whichever is later).  
If you and the landlord agree that you should lodge the bond directly , you can do that online 
using the Tenant Bond Lodgement Form on the  ACT Revenue Office website.  Tips for filling 
in the form include:  
 If there is more than one tenant who has contributed to the bond, make sure that all 
individuals are clearly listed on the form as parties to the bond.  
 Do not include children or tenants who have not contributed any money  to the bond. 
ACT Revenue will generally refund the bond to the persons listed in equal shares.   
Written consent is required where the refund is not in equal shares.  
 Provide contact numbers and email addresses for all persons listed as parties to the 
bond.  This is important as ACT Revenue may need to contact you at the end of your 
tenancy about how to refund the bond.  
 If the contact details for any of the parties to the bond change during the tenancy from 
those listed on the bond lodgement form, make sure y ou update those details with the 
ACT Revenue  Office .  
 There are special rules for how to manage the bond when there is a change of co -
tenants during a co -tenancy.   See the section on share housing below for more 
information about this.  
More information ab out how to lodge a bond (for tenants and landlords) is available on the 
ACT Revenue Office website at: https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/rental -bonds .  
Regardless of who lodges the bond, make sure that you get a receipt  from the 
ACT Revenue Office as proof that the bond has been lodged . If you are not given a 
receipt , contact the Office of Rental B onds  to ask for one .  
Rental Bond Help Program  
If you want to start a tenancy but  your income is low to moderate and you  cannot afford to 
pay the bond upfront, you may be eligible for the  ACT Government’s  Rental Bond Help 28 
 Program. The Program offers to pay up to 100% of the rental bond for approved applicants, 
as a loan that is interest free and can be repaid over 24 months .  
For more information, see the Housing ACT website at:  
https://www.myaccount.act.gov.au/rentalbondhelp/s/   
Alternatives to bonds  
The law permits landlords  and tenants to use guarantees or indemnities instead of, or in 
addition to, a bond in some circumstances. A guarantee or indemnity is basically a 
contractual promise by a third party (e.g. a parent of one of the tenants) that they will be  
liable for the t enant’s compliance with their obligations under the  lease . For example, if the 
tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord can seek payment from the person who provided the 
guarantee or indemnity. If acceptable to a landlord, this type of arrangement may be a u seful 
option for a tenant who is not able to pay the bond upfront.  
A guarantee or indemnity can only be used ( it will only be legally enforceable) up to the 
maximum amount payable as a bond (i.e. 4 weeks’ rent). This means:  
 when used in addition to  a bond, the guarantee or indemnity can only make up the 
difference (e.g. the tenant might pay a bond of 2 weeks’ rent, and use a guarantee or 
indemnity to cover the other 2 weeks’ rent), or  
 when used instead of a bond, the guarantee or indemnity can only be for a maximum 
amount up to 4 weeks’ rent.  
Importantly, there are additional strict rules that apply if the guarantee or indemnity is being 
provided to the tenant on a commercial basis (by a company, rather than a relative or friend). 
Companies may only offer commercial alternatives to bonds in the ACT if the 
standard contract used for the product is registered with the ACT Government  (the 
Commissioner for Fair Trading).  
This regulatory scheme is intended to provide protection to renters from commercial 
contracts that may contain significant fees payable by tenants .  
There are currently no registered commercial alternative to bond products.  This means  that 
there are currently no legal commercial alternatives to bonds  in the ACT . However non 
commercial ar rangements are permitted.  For example, a family member could provid e a 
guarantee on your behalf instead of a bond.   
 
CONDITION REPORT  
A landlord or real estate agent is required to give you two copies of the condition report  no 
later than the day after you move in . Condition reports must be  substantially the same as the  
form published by the ACT  Government. A copy of the form is available on the ACT Revenue 
website : https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1093043/Condition -
Report.pdf   
 29 
 You must:  
 Check to see if you agree with the report . If you disagree with the report, make 
comments on the report about which parts you disagree  with and why.  
 Send a signed copy (with your comments, if any) back to the landlord  or agent. You must 
send the report back within two weeks . 
You might wish to take photos  of the condition of the property , and in particular any signs 
of damage or parts of the condition report with which you disagree.  Photos or videos can be 
attached to the condition report when you send it back.  
The condition report  is used as evidence to resolve disputes at the end of the tenancy  about 
any damage you may have caused (and whether you should get your bond back) , so it is 
important that it accurately reflects the condition of the property.  
If you do no t sign and return a copy  of the condition report within two weeks , you are 
taken to agree with the report.  
If a new co -tenant is added to a ten ancy agreement during the course of a tenancy , the 
existing co -tenants will also need to provide the joining co -tenant with a copy of the original 
condition report for the tenancy.  Se e the section below on share housing  for more 
information.  
MINIMUM HOUSING STANDARDS : CEILING  
INSULATION  
The Act allows the Government to set minimum housing standards for rental properties . 
A minimum housing standard for energy efficiency – a ceiling insulation standard  –
commenced on  1 April 2023  with a phase in period until 30 November 2026 .  To date, no 
other minimum housing standards have been set . However, landlords do have a general 
obligation to provide the rental premises that are habitable  and also reasonably safe, 
clean,  and secure.  
The ceiling insulation standard for rental homes is designed to help improve energy 
performance, increase thermal comfort, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to 
climate change resilience.  
Around half of the energy used in an average Canberra home is for  heating and cooling.  Up 
to 35 per cent of heat is lost through the ceiling over the colder months in an uninsulated 
Canberra house.  
Installing effective insulation in houses reduces the amount of warmth escaping in winter and 
the amount of heat ente ring in summer.  This ensures that houses are more comfortable, 
reducing heating and cooling bills and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  30 
 What is the ceiling insulation standard?  
 
Ceiling insulation is measured with reference to an ‘R’ value.  The ‘R value is a measure of 
thermal resistance; t he higher the R -value of insulation , the more it slows heat flow and the 
better it insulates. The standard requires rental homes with no insulation or existing ceiling 
insulation below an R -value of R2 , to install or upgrade the ceiling insulation to a 
minimum R -value of R5 . R5 is recommended for the ceiling and is the standard insulation 
level used in new builds.  
Rental homes with ceiling insulation rated at R2 or above will not require any upgrades as  
they will already meet the minimum standard.  
The standard will apply to all types of rental properties , including  (public, private and 
community housing ).  
For more information about the standard, refer to the website on minimum energy efficiency 
standards for rental homes .  
Compliance with the ceiling insulation standard  
Landlord s must:  
 Ensure the rental premises complies with the standard by the required date (see below) 
and keep records demonstrating compliance;  
❖ Or, if an exemption from the standard applies, keep records supporting the 
exemption; and  
 Tell you  whether the property meets the required stan dard when advertising the property 
and when entering the lease. See above in the section on advertising requirements  for 
more information, and  
 If you request a copy of the landlord’ s records about the property’s compliance with the 
minimum housing standard, the landlord must  provide a copy of their records to you.  
If, at some point during a tenancy, your landlord becomes aware that the property does not 
comply, or no longer complies  with a minimum housing standard, they must ensure the 
property complies with the standard as soon as practicable  after they become aware of 
non-compliance.  
When will landlords need to comply with the ceiling insulation standard?  
The minimum standard came into  effect on 1 April 2023, with a phase in period extending to 
30 November 2026.  
From 1 April 2023, all properties will be required to comply with the minimum standard after 
a new lease is signed. The length of time that the lan dlord  will have to comply with the 
standard from signing a new lease  will depend on whether the lease is signed before or after 
1 December 2026.  
 From 1 April 2023:  Landlords  are required to indicate whether their property meets the 
minimum standards in any  rental advertisements and lease agreements.  31 
  From 1 April 2023 – 30 November 2026  (phase -in period) : During the phase -in period, 
properties will need to comply with the minimum standard within nine months after 
signing a new lease . (If no new lease is sign ed in this period, then properties must 
nevertheless comply by 30 November 2026).  
 From 1 December 2026  (after the phase -in period): After the phase -in period, from 
1  December  2026, any property entering the rental market has three months from the 
date a new lease is signed  to comply with the minimum standard.  
Are there  exempt ions to the ceiling insulation standard?  
There are exemptions available for some properties. Some exemp tions are permanent, and 
some are temporary.  
Permanent exemptions  apply for properties that are:  
 Heritage -listed and where installing insulation would compromise the heritage value.  
 Lower floor units in apartment complexes (as they are effectively insulate d by the 
apartments above).  
 Dwellings where insulation cannot be feasibly installed due to physical constraints, such 
as roof design.  
 Dwellings where the cost of installing ceiling insulation is over $10,000 (although  if this 
exemption applies,  as much wor k as can be done for up to $10,000 must be undertaken , 
focusing on rooms in which the  tenants will spend mo st time, such as lounge/living 
rooms and bedrooms).  
Temporary exemptions  apply where:  
 The property is a top -floor unit of an apartment building, and the owners corporation 
refuses permission  for the installation of ceiling insulation , or is in the process of 
arranging ceiling insulation to be installed collectively.  
 The property (or a substantial part of the property) is going to be demolished within 
2 years of signing the lease. If this is the case, you  must be notified of this before signing 
the lease.  
 You object in writing to  the ceiling insulation  work being undertaken  (see further below) . 
 You are  the former owner of the property and are renting the property from the new 
owner on a temporary basis (for up to 12 months).  
Once a temporary exemption stops applying, the property must meet the minimum standard:  
 within nine months , if a temporary exemption stops applying to a property be tween 1 
April 2023 and 30 November 2026, or  
 within three months , if a temporary exemption stops applying to a property after 30 
November 2026.  32 
 Access to the property to ensure the property complies with a minimum 
housing standard  
The landlord will have a temporary exemption  from complying with the ceiling insulation 
standard if you object in writing to provid ing access to the property .  However, the law 
gives the landlord the right to proceed with the installation despite your objections, if they 
wish to do  so.  
Landlords are allowed to access to the property to inspect the property, or have work 
undertaken, to ensure it complies with a minimum housing standard . However, the less or 
must only enter premises for the purpose of an inspection or undertaking work if it is 
reasonable and necessary  to do so.  
To obtain ac cess, your l andlord  must give you 1 week’s notice  (or less if you agree) . Unless 
you agree otherwise , the landlord is not entitled to enter the property before 8am or after 
6pm or on Sundays or public holidays.  
You should be aware that if your landlord needs access to the property to comply with the 
ceiling insulation standard, they may need access on several occasions.  For example, they 
may need access to:  
• have an assessor check what, if any, insulation is already in the property ; 
• have an electrical inspection to check it is safe to install the insulation (this is a 
mandatory  requirement to ensure safety) ; 
• undertake any electrical work needed to make the property safe to install insulation  
• install the ceiling insulation  (this  should be able to be done  during normal working 
hours, generally in less than a day ); and 
• check that the ceiling insulation and electrical work have been completed to 
standard.  
If you are having difficulties negotiating appropriate access times with your landlord you can 
seek legal advice . If you cannot agree on an access arrangements , either you or your 
landlord may need to apply to ACAT for orders in relation to access.  
Rights for tenants if the property does not  comply with a minimum housing 
standard  
If the property does not  comply with the minimum standard within the designated time 
period  after the tenancy has st arted (and no exemption applies) , you can apply to ACAT for 
an order:  
• to end the tenancy  (without penalty e.g., withou t having to pay compensation for 
breaking the lease ) 
• for a rent reduction  for the period where the property was required to meet the 
minimum standard but did not, or  33 
 • for compensation for any loss you have suffered due to the property not meeting the 
minimum standard.  
You may also apply to ACAT for dispute resolution  in circumstances inc luding where:  
• you want to dispute the landlord’s claim that the property meets the standard , or  
• an exemption is found to be based on a false or misleading statement . 
If you are considering making an application to ACAT, you may want to seek legal advice  
before making your application.    
You should be aware that if the landlord was not able to comply with the minimum standard 
because you did not allow them access to the property, then ACAT may  refuse  an order to 
end a tenancy or an order for rent reduction or compensation.  
Will the rental property be safe once ceiling insulation has been installed?  
The ACT Government has put measures  in place  to ensure ceiling insulation is installed 
safely . The law requires that ceiling insulation installations or upgrades to meet the minimum 
standard  must  be installed by certified insulation installers  (the landlord cannot install it 
themselves).  
To prevent electrical or fire risks, licensed electricians must complete an electrical safety 
check before the insulation is installed . If any issues are identified during the check, and 
electrical work is required, a licensed electrician must undertake the work and then complete 
a certificate to confirm the work has been completed.  Your landlord is required to keep 
records of this work and you can request copies of the documenta tion if you want to check 
that the work was undertaken safely.  
 A note for la ndlords:   
 Ceiling Inspections:  The law does not impose any specific rules about who may  
check the level of ceiling insulation present at the property.  
For safety reasons , the Government  strongly recommend s that ceiling insulation 
inspections are only unde rtaken by  suitably qualified persons ,such as those who 
have  extensive experience working at heights and in roof spaces, expertise in 
assessing R values of insulation, and/or  who have undertaken appropriate training.  
 Electrical Checks: The law requires  that a licensed electrician  must  undertake an 
electrical safety inspection before  insulation is installed (or upgraded), to identify if 
any electrical work is required  to make sure the installation or upgrade can occur 
safely.   
the law requires the  electrician  to check for the following issues and fix them before 
insulation can be installed:  
❖ unsafe wiring in the roof space or wiring that is rated incorrectly  
❖ whether  installation of insulation will lead to any electrical wiring or circuits 
being materially adversely affected  34 
 ❖ whether  a Residual Current Device (RCD) needs to be installed in the 
relevant circuit  
❖ Removal of incandescent downlights and halogen downlights i n areas where 
insulation is to be installed and replaced with IC -4 rated LED downlights.  
Note:  Halogen and other incandescent downlights generate a lot of heat, 
and if insulation covers them this creates a fire risk.  
The electrician will complete the foll owing paperwork:  
❖ Certificate of Electrical Safety (they are required to submit this to Access 
Canberra) ; and  
❖ Required Electrical Work Report: States whether any required electrical work 
report was identified, and includes details of the required electrical  work 
If required electrical work is identified:  
❖ Completed Electrical Work Report: Once required electrical work is 
completed, the electrician fills in this form with details of the work.  
You should  ask for a copy of the above to keep as documentary evidence that the 
electrical check/work required under the regulation was completed (including the 
invoice for the work).  
 Installing Ceiling Insulation:  Under the law, only insulation installers with an 
Insulation Installer Certification from the Energy Efficiency Council Certifications 
program  can install insulation under the minimum sta ndard.  
This is to ensure the safety of tenants and the rental home. To find a certified installer, visit 
the Energy Eff iciency Council website .  You should also be aware that if you do not comply 
with the legal requirements for the  safe installation of ceiling insulation any insurance you 
have in relation to the property may be invalidated.   
SMOKE ALARMS  
Your landlord is responsible for making sure that smoke alarms are installed and are in 
working order at the start of the tenancy.  
A smoke alarm must be installed:  
 in each storey of the property that has a bedroom:  
❖ in every corridor or hallway associated with a bedroom ;  
❖ or if there is no corridor or hallway, in every part of the property that divides a 
bedroom from the remainder of the property ; and 
 in each storey of the property that does not have a bedroom.  
Each smoke alarm must comply with Australian Standard 3786, must be installed on or near 
the ceiling and may be battery operated or hard -wired.   35 
 If the smoke alarm is battery operated, you are responsible for replacing the battery 
during the tenancy .  
LOOSE-FILL ASBESTOS  
The law in the ACT aims to prevent tenants from renting properties that are known to contain 
loose -fill asbestos, because of the serious health and safety risks from these properties. 
The ACT Government operated a voluntary buyback scheme that ensured that most 
properties that were identified as being affected by loose -fill asbestos have been demolished 
and the land remediated. Howe ver, a very small number of affected properties remain.  
The ACT Government maintains an online register that lists the remaining affected 
properties. From 1 July 2020, any residential tenancy agreement entered into for an 
affected property that is listed on the register will be void (meaning it will be invalid). 
The same will apply for occupancy agreements, subletting and any other agreement to allow 
someone to live in an affected property.  
The Government’s register is avai lable at: http://www.asbestostaskforce.act.gov.au/the -
list/the -register . 
You can check the register to see whether the property you are considering renting is 
affected by loose -fill asbestos. Affected properties are also required to prominently display 
an asbestos management plan which would be visible during inspections.  
Anyone who enters into a tenancy agreement (or other agreement) to live in an affected 
property will be  entitled to apply to ACAT for compensation.  
Note:  Some older properties (built before 1990) may contain bonded or sheet asbestos.  
Properties containing bonded asbestos can still be rented out.  When your tenancy 
commences your lan dlord is required to eit her provide you with an absestos report in relation 
to the property (if one exists) or an asbestos advice notice  (which provides information about 
common places in a property tha t may contain asbestos).  
  36 
 DURING YOUR TENANCY  
TENANT’S OBLIGATIONS  
As a tenant you have the right to exclusive possession and ‘quiet enjoyment’ of your new 
home, which means your landlord cannot interfere with your use of the property in 
reasonable peace, comfort and privacy.  
You also have obligations as a tenant. In particular:  
 You must pay your rent when it is due.  
 You must take reasona ble care of the property and keep it reasonably clean (having 
regard to its condition at the start of the tenancy) . 
 You must not intentionally or negligently damage the property (or allow others to damage 
the property).  
 You must notify your landlord  of any  damage to the property or required repairs as soon 
as possible.  
 You must obtain your landlord’s consent if you want to make changes to the property  or 
if you want to keep a pet  (if your landlord indicated at the start of the tenancy that 
permission to keep a pet is required) .  
 You can only use the property for a residential purpose  (meaning you can’t use  the 
property as a place of business  - unless otherwise agreed in writing with your landlord) . 
 You cannot use (or allow others to use) the property for any illegal purpose. Permitting 
illegal activity on the property may allow the landlord to apply to ACAT to end your 
residential  tenancy agreemen t. 
 You must not interfere with the neighbours’ quiet enjoyment of their homes or use the 
property in a way that causes nuisance to the local community.  
 You must not leave the property vacant for more than 3 weeks without informing your 
landlord or real est ate agent.  This is not asking for permission, it is simply notifying them 
of your absence.  
 You must not sublet (allow someone else to live in) part or all of the property without the 
written consent of the  landlord (see further below  on subletting ). You can  have non-
paying guests  stay for short periods , but you can’t let new people move in without 
consent .  
 If you want to leave a co -tenancy while your other co -tenants remain , or if you want to 
add a new co-tenant to your tenancy agreement , you must follow the required steps .  
See the section on share housing  for more information.  
 If your rental is a unit,  you must comply with the owners ’ corporation rules.  
 If you are a tenant in subsidised accommodation , such as community -based social or 
affordable housing tenancies, you may also be required to demonstrate your on -going  37 
 eligibility to continue living in the property. See the section on subsidised accommodation  
for more information.  
Finally, you should be aware that engaging in conduct  that is threatening, intinidating 
harrassing, or abusive towards your landlord (or their family members) or your agent or other 
representative of your landlord, may be grounds to end your tenancy.   
RENT  
You have an obligation to pay rent in full and on t ime. Failure to pay your rent can be a 
ground for your landlord to end your tenancy . 
How much and how often?  
Your residential tenancy agreement will state how much rent is to be paid and when  (how 
often) rent is to be paid . Check that the rent as advertise d for the property matches what is 
in the agreement.  
A landlord or real estate agent cannot require you to pay more than two weeks’ rent in 
advance .  However, if you would like to pay rent at different intervals you may wish to 
discuss this with your land lord (for example, if it suits you to pay rent monthly in accordance 
with your income cycle  you could ask to pay rent monthly ). If you are being asked to pay 
more than two weeks’ rent in advance, you are entitled to say no.  
If you agree to pay rent on a mo nthly basis, check the amount payable per calendar month 
stated in the agreement. Be aware that it will be more than 4 weeks’ rent if the property was 
advertised with a weekly rent amount (as a month is usually longer than 4 weeks). For 
example:  
 A weekly r ent of $500 becomes $2172.62 payable per calendar month  (not $2000) . 
If you have any questions, ask the real estate agent or landlord how they calculated the rent 
amount.  
Method of payment  
The residential tenancy agreement should also state how rent will b e paid  e.g. directly into 
a bank account , cash, Bpay or by a payment app . Once agreed at the start of the tenancy, 
the way in which rent is to be paid cannot be changed unless both parties agree  to the 
change . For example, if your agreement states that your rent is to be paid into a bank 
account, the landlord cannot demand that you start using a third party payment app  to pay 
your rent . Be aware that some methods of payment may involve processing or 
admin istrative fees.    
Receipts for rent or bond  
If the rent is paid directly into a bank account, the landlord is not required to give you a 
receipt. The landlord is required to provide a receipt when the rent is paid:  
 in person —a receipt must be given at that time; or  
 by another method —the receipt should be provided or sent by post within one week.  38 
 A receipt for rent (or bond) should include:  
 the date of payment;  
 the period for which the payment was made;  
 which property the payment was made for; and  
 whether the  payment was for bond or rent.  
A note for landlords:   
 Under the Act you are required to keep records of all rent paid for one year after the 
tenancy ends. Be aware that other legislation (e.g. tax laws) may require you to keep 
records for a longer period.  
RENT INCREASES  
There are rules about how often your rent  can be increased  and by how much . Your landlord 
or real estate agent must also follow certain rules  to give  you proper  notice of the proposed 
increase. Make sure you know your rights if your landlord or agent proposes to increase your 
rent. 
The way the rent increase rules apply depends on whether you are in a fixed term or 
periodic residential tenancy agreement (see the section on fixed or periodic  agreements 
above if you are unsure what type of agreement you have  or seek legal advice  about your 
agreement ).  
How often can my landlord increase the rent?  
Rent cannot  be increased at intervals of less than 12 months from the start of the 
tenancy or from the date of the last rent increase  regardless of whether the tena ncy is fixed 
or periodic (unless you have agreed to a  special term allowing more frequent increas es and 
the term  was endorsed by ACAT).  
How much can my rent increase in a fixed term tenancy?  
If you are in a fixed term  agreement,  your rent cannot be increased  during the fixed 
term , unless your  agreement specifically provide s for rent increases to occur.  This is 
not common  but check your agreement to make sure this does not apply to you.  If your 
agreement does provide for rent increases , it must state the amount of the increase or 
the method for calculating the increase as pa rt of the agreement .  
If you are approaching the end of a fixed term agreement, remember that unless you end the 
tenancy, it will automatically become a periodic tenancy after the end of the fixed term. If  you 
are happy for your tenancy to automatically co ntinue as a more flexible periodic agreement, 
the rules on rent increases  in periodic tenancies  will apply from when your tenancy becomes 
periodic.  Your landlord cannot end your tenancy for no reason, or because you do not agree 
to a proposed rent increas e (see the section on When Your Landlord Can End Your 
Tenancy ). 39 
 If you are considering entering a new fixed term agreement (e.g. for a further  12 months  in 
the property), the new rent payable will be a matter for negotiation between you and the 
landlord because it will  be a new contract.  
How much can my landlord increase the rent  in a periodic tenancy ? 
The rules in the Act aim to ensure that rent increase s are ‘not excessive ’ (unless exceptional 
circumstances apply).  The Act permits landlords to increase rent  by a certain amount, which 
(in very simplified terms ), is the inflation rate on rental prices plus 10%  of the inflation 
amount . In effect, this amount acts  as a limit on rent increases.  
 Any increase above the limit is generally considered an excessive  rent increase  (unless 
your landlord can convice ACAT it is not excessive) .  
 Your  landlord can only impose an excessive rent increase  if you agree OR if ACAT 
approves the increase .  
 If your landlord or agent proposes a rent increase, they must tell you whether the 
increase is above  the limit . If you want to check their calculations, s ee further below for 
how to calculate the limit and notification requirements.  
 You do not  have  to agree to an excessive rent increas e.  
 If you do not agree to an excessive rent increase, you can inform your landlord or agent. 
If the landlord still wants  to pursue the increase, i t is the ir responsibility to apply to ACAT 
to obtain approval for it. The landlord will need to show ACAT that the rent increase 
should not be considered excessive  in all the circumstances of the case . 
The rules on excessive rent increases apply in periodic tenancies  only.  
How do I work out the rent limit amount  myself?  
If you are in a periodic tenancy and you receive notice of a proposed rent increase, you 
might w ant to check for yourself whether the increase is above or below the permitted  limit 
on  rent increases.  
The formula is based on the Consumer Price Index ( CPI) published by the Australian Bureau 
of Statistics ( ABS ). The CPI is a commonly used measure of inflation. The ABS publishes 
new CPI figures every quarter at: https://www.abs.gov.au/Price -Indexes -and-Inflation . You 
will need to find the CPI figures for the cost of rent in the ACT. These figures are called 
‘index numbers’. To find the index numbers for rent in the ACT, you will need to look for the 
CPI table which details specific expenditure classes for each cap ital city (usually in a 
detailed Excel spreadsheet available for download on the ABS website).  
To calculate the rent increase limit  amount , use this formula:  
𝟏𝟏𝟎×(𝑨−𝑩
𝑩) 
 
 
 
Where:  40 
  “A” is the index number  for rents in the ACT in the CPI figures most recently published by 
the ABS; and  
 “B” is the index number  for rents in the ACT in the CPI figures that applied when your 
rent last went up (or at the start of the tenancy, if this is your first rental increase). This 
number should be from at least 12 months ago.  
For example:  
 A tenant is in a periodic tenancy co mmencing from 1 January 2022, with a weekly rent of 
$600. The landlord proposes to increase the rent from 1 January 2023.  
 The index number for rents in Canberra in January  2023 was 120.0 . This is the number 
“A”. 
 The index number  for rents in Canberra in January  2022 (when the periodic tenancy 
commenced)1 was 113.2. This is the number “B”. 
 Substituting these numbers into the formula will give you the rent increase limit amount : 
 
𝟏𝟏𝟎×(𝟏𝟐𝟎.𝟎−𝟏𝟏𝟑.𝟐
𝟏𝟏𝟑.𝟐) 
=𝟔.𝟔 
The rent increase limit  amount  is 6.6%. This means your rent can be increased by up to 
6.6% before it will be considered an excessive rent increase.  
As the tenant’s rent was previously $600 per week, it  may be increased by $ 40 per week 
(6.6% of $600) before it exceeds the permitted amount . 
How much notice do I need to be given before a rent increase  in a periodic 
tenancy ? 
For any rental increase to be effective, the landlord must give you 8 weeks’ notice in 
writing . The notice must  state:   
 the amount of the proposed increase  
 whether th e proposed increase  is more than the rent increase limit amount , and  
 if the proposed increase is more than the permitted amount – the notice must state that if 
you do not agree to it, the landlord must seek ACAT’s approval before the 
increase can take effect . 
This last requirement is intended to ensure that tenants know they do not need to agree  to 
an excessive rent increase and that they have the right to have ACAT review the landlord’s 
proposal.  
 
1 If you have previously had a rent increase, this should be the reference month, rather than the start of your 
periodic tenancy.   41 
 If you thin k that you have not been given proper notice of the rent increase in accordance 
with these requirements, you should raise this as soon as possible with your landlord or real 
estate agent, and/or seek legal advice . The rent increase will not be valid under the Act 
unless it complies with the notification requirements  (or it is otherwise approved by ACAT) .    
Can I challenge a rent increase that is less than the permitted amount ? 
If your landlord wants to increase your rent by less than the rent increase limit amount , they 
are allowed  to, provided the other rules around rental increases are being followed  (e.g. you 
have been given proper notice and 12  months  or more have passed  since the last increase ).  
However, if you disagree with the proposed increase (for example, if you think the property is 
in a poor state of repair and not worth the rent the landlord is asking) , you can still make an 
application to ACAT to challenge the prop osed increase.  
Be aware that if you challenge an increase that is less than the permitted amount , you will 
need to show ACAT that the increase should be considered excessive. You may wish to  
seek legal advice  before taking the matter to ACAT .  
How will ACAT decide rent increase disputes?  
In deciding whether to approve a rent increase, ACAT is required to consider:  
 when the rent was last increased, and by how much  
 the landlord ’s outgoings or costs in relation to the property  
 the value of any services, or goods or fixtures the landlord provides to the tenant  
 the state of repair of the property  
 rental rates for comparable properties , and  
 the value of any improvements to the prope rty carried out lawfully by the tenant .  
ACAT will consider any other relevant circumstances of the case  and determine the matter 
taking into account the views of the tenant and of the landlord.  
Can I move out if I am unhappy with the rent increase?  
If you are unhappy with the proposed rent increase in a periodic tenancy and either you do 
not wish to go to ACAT , or ACAT has approved the increase, you can decide to end your 
periodic  tenancy  and move out instead. If you want to do this, y ou must give 3 weeks’ 
written notice  to the landlord.  
RENT REDUCTIONS  
If you are experiencing problems with your property that you cannot resolve with your 
landlord or agent, y ou can apply to ACAT  for an order that the landlord do a certain thing 
(such as complete repairs or comply with the minimum standard) and / or that your rent be  
reduced  for a period of time to compensate you  for the landlord not complying with the rental 
agreement . To obtain a rent reduction order, y ou will need to show ACAT that  your use 
or enjoyment  of the property has significantly diminished  because:  42 
  you have lost the benefit of an  appliance, furniture, facility or service supplied by the 
landlord  (e.g. the landlord agreed to provide a washing machine and it is broken  and not 
being fixed ) 
 the landlord  has failed  to maintain the property in a reasonable state of repair (for 
matters which are the responsibility of the landlord)  
 the landlord has faile d to provide or maintain locks or other security devices to ensure 
that the property is reasonably secure  
 you have  lost the use of all or part of the property  (e.g. part of the garden cannot be used 
because of storm damage that has not been fixed within a reasonable time) , or 
 the landlord has substantially interfered with your quiet enjoyment of the property  – this 
includes your right to use the property in reasonable peace, comfort and privacy  and to 
exercise all of your rights as a tenant . 
You can also ap ply for a rent reduction or compensation if the rental property does not 
comply with the ceiling insulation minimum standard  (and no exemption applies) . 
Remember, you are not permitted to withhold rent  if you are in a dispute with your 
landlord. If you do withold rent, you will be in breach of your agreement and your landlord 
may seek to evict you. Instead, y ou must apply to ACAT  for an order to reduce the rent . You 
may wish to seek legal advice  before making an application.   
ACAT may also make other orders, such as an order that the landlord make any outstanding 
repairs or that the landlord ensures the proeprty complies with the ceiling insulation standard 
within a specified timeframe.  
If your landlord has failed  to ensure the prop erty complies with the ceiling insulation 
standard , you may  also seek an order to end the tenancy if you no longer want to continue 
living at the property. ACAT can also make orders for compensation if you have su ffered loss 
as a result of the landlord’s failure to ensure the premises meets the minimum standard.  
ACCESS  TO YOUR HOME  
When you rent a property you have the right to exclusive possession and ‘quiet enjoyment’ 
of your new home, which means your landlord cannot interfere with your use of the property 
in reasonable peace, comfort and privacy.   A landlord or their agent must not require access 
to the premises during the tenancy except as provided by your tenancy agreement, the law 
or an order of ACA T. 
The general rules are that the landlord  must not have access — 
• on Sundays; or  
• on public holidays; or  
• before 8 am and after 6 pm;  
However, there are exceptions to these general rules around access  times . These 
exceptions include gaining access:  43 
 • for the purpose of carrying out urgent repairs  or for health or safety reasons in 
relation to the premises; or  
• with your consent.  
You may agree to give you r landlord  access to the propert y at any time if you wish.  
If your landlord  contact s you seeking access and you do not think it is reasonable or 
permitted , you can refuse and they will have the option of making an application to ACAT for 
an order for reasonable access.  It is important t hat you are aware of the rules relating to 
reasonable access. See below  for more  information or seek legal advice . 
INSPECTIONS  
How often can the landlord inspect the property?  
Landlords are  entitled to conduct the following standard inspections :  
 An inspection of the property during the first month of the agreement . This is to make 
sure that there are no problems and that you are using the property  as a home rather 
than for some other purpos e. 
 In addition to th e first inspection, your landlord may inspect the property twice within 
each twelve -month period.  
 In addition to the first inspection and the tw o annual  routine inspections, the landlord may 
inspect the property in the final month of the tenancy. This is to make sure that the 
property is in a state of repair ready for a new tenancy.  
The effect of these rules is that it is normal in a 12 month fixed term agreement for you to 
have an inspection every quarter.  
In a periodic tenancy, after the first year, you r landlord may conduct inspections twice a year.  
You do not have to agree to any other inspections, unless they are for prospective new 
tenants or purcha sers of the property (see below). For example, landlords cannot require 
you to allow  additional inspections as a condition of having a pet.  If a landlord or agent wants 
to ‘re -inspect’ a property after raising issues in relation to the condition of the pro perty, this 
will count towards the twice yearly inspection limit.  
Similarly, your landlord cannot require additional inspections if you want to add or remove a 
co-tenant from the tenancy agreement. If a landlord or agent does want to conduct an 
inspection  which coincides with a change of tenants, this inspection counts towards the 2 per 
year limit on inspections. See the section below on share housing  for more information.  44 
 How much notice do I get before an inspection?  
Your landlord must give you at least 1 weeks’ notice  in writing before any standard 
inspection.  
Inspections for prospective tenants or purchasers  
In addition to the standard inspections discussed above, i f you are moving out and the 
landlord wants to find new tenants, you must provide reasonable  access to  the property to  
prospective tenants during the final 3 weeks of the tenancy. Your landlord must give you 
24 hours’ notice  that access is required.  
If the landlord is selling the property,  they must notify you of their intention to sell.  Once  they 
have done this, you must provide reasonable access for inspections by prospective 
purchases . Your landlord must give you 48 hours ’ notice  that access is required . Only 2 
inspections  per week  are permitted  for pros pective purchasers  (unless you agree to more) . 
If you live in a rental property that is on the market for sale for a considerable time and your 
landlord requires access to the prop erty for inspections  for more than 8 weeks , you have 
the right to end your agreement and move out early , if you wish . See further the section 
on ‘Ending Your Tenancy’ . 
You can choose whether you wish to be present when other people are being shown around 
your home. If you think your landlord’s requests for access are unreasonable , you may wish 
to seek legal advice  about your options.  
What time can inspections take place?  
Inspections must take place at a time negotiated by you and the landlord. The agreed time 
should be reasonable, taking into account your work and other commitments as well as 
those of your  landlord.  
Unless you consent, the landlord is not entitled to enter the property for inspections before 
8am or after 6pm or on Sundays or public holidays.  
Your landlord is not entitled to use their copy of the keys to enter the property if you disagree 
about a suitable time. If there is a dispute about when it is reasonable to undertake the 
inspection, you or the landlord may apply to ACAT for an order about when the inspection 
will take place.  
REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE  
Your landlord is responsible for main taining the property, keeping it in a reasonable state of 
repair, and ensuring it remains reasonably secure. They are also responsible for ensuring 
your property meets the ceiling insulation standard .  
You should not intentionally or negligently damage the  property. If you do, you may be 
responsbile for paying for any damage to the property.  
You are responsible for notifying the landlord if there is a need for a repair.  This is 
important because if you do not notify your landlord about the need for repair and the 
problem gets worse, you m ay be considered liable for some of the damage.  For example, if 45 
 you do not notify your landlord about a water leak in the ceiling and the ceiling subsequently 
collapses, you may be considered to have contributed to the damage.  
The landlord’s obligations to carry out the repairs depend on whether the repair is classified 
as urgent or not under the Act.  
Urgent repairs  
The following are urgent repairs:  
 a burst water service  
 a blocked or broken toilet  
 a serious roof leak  
 a gas leak  
 a dangerous electrical fault  
 flooding or serious flood damage  
 serious storm or fire damage  
 a failure of gas, electricity or water supply to the property  
 a failure of a ny refrigerator  or laundry appliance  supplied with the property, or any 
service for hot water, cooking, heating or cooling  
 any fault or damage that makes the property  unsafe or insecure , or is likely to cause 
injury to person or property , or 
 a serious fault in any door, staircase, lift or other common area tha t prevents (or causes 
undue inconvenience to) the tenant accessing or using the property.  
You must notify the landlord about the need for urgent repairs as soon as practicable .  
There is no fixed timeframe within which an urgent repair  must be completed. The landlord 
must carry out an urgent repair as soon as necessary, having regard to the nature of 
the problem.   
You can arrange for an urgent repair to be carried out at  the landlord ’s expense , but only if:  
 your landlord  cannot be contacted ( you must have made reasonable attempts at 
contact) , or they fail to perform the urgent repairs  within a reasonable time  
 the value of the urgent repairs does not exceed 5% of your annual rent (e.g. if your rent 
is $450 per week, then you can arrange urgent repairs up to the value of $1,170 (5% of 
450 x 52 weeks) , and  
 you attempt first to contact the qualified tradesperson nominated by your landlord in your 
tenancy agreement. If your landlord has not nominated a tradesperson , or if that person  
cannot be contacted or is unavailable, you can contact any qualified tradesperson to 
undertake the repairs.  46 
 If you follow these requirements strictly, then you can have your landlord billed directly for 
the urgent repairs. If you  arrange urgent repairs outside of these requirements, you will be 
liable for the cost.  
Non-urgent repairs  
Any repairs th at are not an ‘urgent’ repair are ordinary repairs. The landlord must make 
these repairs within 4 weeks of being notified  (unless otherwise agreed with you).  
Repairs to common property in apartment buildings  
If you live in a unit  titled building (a unit, t ownhouse or apartment) and repairs are required to 
common property, notify your landlord as soon as possible. Your landlord  must take steps 
to require the owners corporation to undertake the repairs as quickly as possible.   You 
should not have to deal with the owners ’ corporation yourself  - that is your landlord’s 
responsibility.  
Regular maintenance by the tenant   
Your landlord is not required to undertake repairs or maintenance that an ordinary tenant 
would reasonably b e expected to do themselves. Common examples of this include that : 
 You are responsible for replacing the battery in smoke alarms (your landlord is 
responsible for making sure that a smoke alarm  is installed , and it is in working order ). 
 You are responsible  for changing light bulbs  unless some specialist expertise or 
equipment is required.  
 You are responsible for standard  upkeep of the g arden  e.g. mowing the lawn and 
weeding.  
If your new home has a garden or a pool, make sure you are clear at the beginning of your 
tenancy what your responsibilities are for maintenance.  
Access for making or inspecting repairs   
For urgent repairs , your landlord must give you reasonable notice  and enter the property 
at a reasonable time . What is reasonable may depend on the circumstances  of the repair 
issue.  
For other non -urgent repairs or maintenance issues, your l andlord  must give you 1 week’s 
notice  (or less if you agree) . Unless you consent, the landlord is not entitled to enter the 
property for inspections before 8am or after 6pm or on Sundays or public holidays.  
Be aware that your landlord also has a right to access the property to inspect the repairs 
undertaken (to ensure they were done correctly or appropriately ).  However, the lessor must 
only enter premises for the purpose of making or inspecting repairs if it is reasonable and 
necessary  to do so.  
Options for tenants if repairs are not undertaken  
If your landlord does not undertake repairs within the required timeframe they will be in 
breach of the  tenancy  agreement.  If this is the case , you can choose to apply to ACAT for 47 
 an order that they undertake repairs or follow the process to end your tenancy . (See the 
section below about ending your tenancy when the  landlord  is in breach of the tenancy 
agreement ). You may also be entitled to a rent reduction . 
MAKING CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY  
(‘MODIFICATIONS ’) 
As a tenant, you may want to make changes (or ‘modifications ’) to the property to make it 
work better for you as a home.  There are some basic rules about modifications you need to 
follow.  
 You cannot make  any modifications without  your landl ord’s written consent . 
Written consent includes consent granted via email or in a mobile phone message. You 
should make sure you keep a record of your landlord’s consent to the modification, in the 
event there is any dispute.  
 You are responsible for the co st of modifications  (unless your landlord agrees to share 
the costs, e.g. if the modification improves the property).   
 You must make sure the modifications are undone at the end of your tenancy, so the 
property is in substantially the same condition as at the beginning of the tenancy, unless 
your landlord agrees to the modifications remaining in place.  
 You are responsible for the cost of undoing the modifications. Your landlord is under no 
obligation to compensate you for the modifications even if they remain in place.  
 Your landlord may impose other reasonable conditions  on their consent to the 
modification  (such as requir ing you to use a suitably qualified tradesperson to do the 
modifications (or to undo them at the end of the tenancy) ). 
The rules for o btaining consent from your landlord depend on what kind of modification you 
want to make.   
If the modification is a ‘special modification, ’ your landlord cannot refuse consent without 
ACAT ’s approval  (see further below).  The landlord has 14  days to decide whether to apply to 
ACAT, otherwise they will be taken to consent.   
For all other modification s, your landlord can only  refuse consent  if it is reasonable for them 
to do so in the circumstances . If your landlord refuses consent and you think this was  
unreasonable, then you may apply to ACAT  to overturn your landlord’s refusal.  
Special modifications  
Special modifications are  any modifications in one of the following categories:  
 Minor modifications  – anything that can be  removed or undone so that the property is 
restored to substantially the same condition as at the start of the tenancy,  fair wear and 
tear excepted . Examples include :  
❖ putting up picture hooks  
❖ installing a shelf  
❖ fixing blinds to a window  48 
 ❖ painting a wall  
❖ planting vegetables, fruit, herbs, flowers or shrubs (under 2 metres), as long as 
existing vegetation (including mature lawns) or plants do not need to be removed, 
and 
❖ installing or placing a compost bin or tumbler in the garden if existing vegetation 
or plants do not need to be removed.  
 Safety modifications  – anything that promotes  the safety of people on the property 
(e.g. furniture anchors or child safety gates ). 
 Security modifications  – anything that improves the security of the property or people 
on th e property (e.g. installing deadlocks or alarms).  
 Disability -related modifications  – anything that a ssists a tenant who has a disability 
(e.g. access ramps, safety rails) . For this type of requet, you  must provide a written 
recommendation from a health practitioner in support of the request . 
 Energy -efficiency modifications  – anything that improve s the energy efficiency of the 
property  (e.g. switching to energy efficient lighting or putting glazing film on windows ). 
 Telecommunications modificati ons – anything that  enables access to 
telecommunication services  (e.g. installing an internet , phone  or cable television 
connection) . 
If you make a request to your landlord in writing for a special modification, your landlord 
must apply to  ACAT within 14 d ays of receiving your request , if they wish to refuse consent.  
If your landlord  does not apply to ACAT, or if they do not respond to your request within 
14 days, then they are taken to have consented to the request.  
The following table summarises the rule s on consent to modifications.  
Type of modification  Can landlord refuse consent?  
 
Special modification:  
˃ Minor modification  
˃ Safety modification  
˃ Security modification  
˃ Disability modification  
˃ Energy efficiency modification  
˃ Telecommunications 
modification  Landlord needs approval from ACAT to refuse 
consent. Landlord must apply to ACAT for this 
approval.  
 
If the tenant requests consent in writing  
(e.g. via email), and the landlord does not 
respond within 14 days, the landlor d is taken to 
have consented.  
 
General modification  
(anything that is not a special 
modification)  Landlord  can refuse consent, without needing 
approval from ACAT,  as long as  the landlord ’s 
decision is reasonable.  
 
Tenant m ay apply to ACAT  for an order al lowing 
the modification  if they believe the landlord has 
unreasonably refused  consent.  49 
  
How will ACAT  decide modifications disputes?  
In any dispute about whether a modification should be permitted (whether a special 
modification or otherwise), ACAT  must consider:  
 whether  the landlord  would suffer significant hardship if the modification were made  
 whether the modification would be contrary to the law for any reason  (e.g. it would not be 
permitted under planning or building laws)  
 whether the modification is likely to require modificati ons to other residential properties or 
common areas (e.g. in apartment buildings) , and  
 whether the modification would result in additional maintenance costs for the landlord . 
ACAT will consider any other relevant circumstances of the case and determine th e matter 
fairly taking into account the views of the tenant and of the landlord.  
CHANGING LOCKS  
Except in an emergency, the landlord or tenant may only change the locks for the property 
with the consent of the other party. The person who changes the locks  is responsible for the 
cost, unless both parties agree that the cost will be shared.  
In the case of an emergency, the landlord or tenant can change the locks without the 
consent of the other party. The person who changed the locks must give the other par ty a 
copy of the new key as soon as possible.  
In a situation of family or personal violence, a tenant (or someone else living at the property) 
who is a protected person under a protection order can change the locks at their own cost 
without the landlord’s  consent. The person must provide a copy of the new key to the 
landlord as soon as possible, unless doing so would affect the ir safety.  
PETS  
If you own a pet and are looking for a new rental property, see  also the information on pets in 
the ‘Starting Your Tenancy’ section above.  
I am living in a rental property. Am I allowed to have a pet?  
You are allowed to have a pet, unless your landlord obtains  the approval of  ACAT to  refuse 
your pet. This is intended to be a case -by-case  process, where ACAT will consider the 
circumstances of the tenant  and landlord,  the nature of the  property and  the type of  pet. This 
process allows for a balance between the rights of tenants and landlor ds.  
The starting point is to check what  your residential tenancy agreement says . Landlords are 
not permitted to include terms in the agreement that prohibit pets outright. However, your 
agreement can require you to ask for the landlord’s consent to have a  pet (look for rules on 
‘keeping animals on the premises ’).   50 
 Some landlords are comfortable with pets and do not require their tenants to notify them or 
seek their consent.  
 If your agreement does not say that your landlord’s consent is required for you to keep a 
pet on the property, then you can go ahead and get a pet.  
 There is no requirement for you to seek the consent of (or even notify) your landlord.  
Some landlords do n ot permit pets on their properties without the tenant seeking their written 
consent first. This requirement  must be specifically  included in  the residential tenancy 
agreement.  
 If your agreement says that you must seek your landlord’s consent in writing bef ore 
getting a pet , then you must ask for consent.  
 If you get a pet without consent (when consent  is required under your agreement ), 
you will be in breach of your agreement . 
If your landlord requires you to seek consent for a pet, there is a process that must be 
followed.   
 You must put the request in writing  to your landlord (email or even a text message is 
fine). Keep a copy of your request.  Make sure your request is as specific as possible – 
What pet would you like to get? How many? Are there any is sues with cleaning or 
maintenance, or neighbours (e.g. in an apartment building), that you may need to think 
about ? Your landlord may want to know how you will handle  these issues . 
 Your landlord must re spond to your request within 14 days of receiving your request .  
 If your landlord does not respond within 14 days, they are taken to have consented to 
your request.  This means you can go ahead and get the pet. You should do your best 
(within reason) to check that your landlord has received your request (and when they 
received it) before getting a pet.  
Your landlord has two options when responding to your request.  
Your landlord can agree to your request, with or without conditions.  
 Your landlord can impose reasonable conditions about the number of animals you are 
allowed to keep on the property, or the cleaning and maintenance of the property.  
 If your landlord wants t o impose other conditions (that do not relate to the number of 
animals or the cleaning and maintenance of the property), your landlord needs to apply 
to ACAT for approval of those conditions.  
 If you think the conditions your landlord wants to impose are un reasonable, you can 
apply to ACAT to resolve the dispute.  
If your landlord wants to  refuse your request,  they must first seek an order from ACAT 
approving their refusal.  
 Your landlord must lodge the application with ACAT within 14  days of receiving your 
request, if they wish to take this route.  51 
 Your landlord may have been to ACAT before and ACAT may have agreed to refuse a 
previous tenant’s request to a pet. This does not mean your landlord can refuse your pet 
outright. Your circum stances, or the type of pet you are requesting, may be different. 
Generally a landlord  will need  ACAT’s approval on a case -by-case basis to refuse any 
request from a tenant for a pet.  However, you should think about the reasons ACAT may 
have previously agr eed that a pet should not be permitted in the property, and whether these 
apply in your case.  
How will ACAT determine applications about pets?  
ACAT will consider the matter independently. ACAT will take into account your views and 
those of the landlord, as  well as the nature of the property and the pet in question.  
ACAT may approve the landlord refusing consent to your pet if:  
 the property is unsuitable for the pet  
 keeping the pet would result in unreasonable damage to the property  
 keeping the pet would be  an unacceptable risk to public health or safety  
 the landlord would suffer significant hardship from the tenant keeping the pet, or  
 keeping the pet would be contrary to the law.   
Key points to remember if you do get a pet  
You have rights and obligations a s a tenant in relation to your pet. In particular:  
 You will be responsible for any damage to the property caused by your pet , 
including if the amount of damage exceeds your bond .  
 Your landlord cannot require you to pay extra bond because you have a pet. 
 Your landlord cannot require you to accept additional inspections because you have a 
pet. 
I live in a unit  titled property. Are the rules on pets any different?  
The rules discussed above will still apply to tenants in unit  titled properties  when  you are 
dealing with your landlord. These rules govern the relationship  between you and your  
landlord  and protect your landlord’s interest in the rental property .  
However, you and your landlord  must also comply with the rules on pets in the Unit Titles 
(Management ) Act 2011 . These rules govern the communal relationships involved  (between 
you and the other residents in the apartment building)  and protect the interests of all owners 
and residents in unit  titled properties.  
The owners corporation rules will govern the process you need to follow as a tenant to make 
sure you are permitted to keep your pet.  
If your owners corporation rules have a ‘pet friendly rule’ that allows pets to be kept without 
seeking consent from the owner’s corporation, then you can h ave a pet in accordance with 
that rule. The pet friendly rule may impose conditions (e.g. around the number of pets you 52 
 may keep, cleaning or maintenance, supervision when using common property etc) so you 
should make sure you understand what the rule requ ires. 
If your owners ’ corporation rules do not have a pet friendly rule, you will need to ask 
the owner s’ corporation for consent to keep your pet, even if you have already 
received the consent of your landlord.  The owners ’ corporation must respond in writing. If 
you do not receive a response within 3 weeks of your request, the owner s corporation is 
taken to consent.  
The owner s corporation may respond by granting consent (which may be subject to 
reasonable conditions), or by refusing consent. If consent is refused, the reasons must be 
stated. The owners ’ corporation may not unreasonably refuse consent.  
If you think the decision of your owners ’ corporation is unreasonable, you may take the 
dispute to ACAT.  
I have a disability and I need an assistance animal. Will my animal be 
allowed?  
The ACT’s discrimination laws (the Discrimination Act 1991 ) prohibit landlords  from 
discriminating against a tenant who has a disability, which includes their reliance on an 
assistance animal. A tenant who needs to get an assistance animal because of their 
disability should still notify their landlord in writing. A landlord  might as k for evidence (e.g. a 
letter from a health practitioner) confirming the need for the animal. Landlords cannot 
lawfully refuse a tenant’s genuine request for an assistance animal.  The same applies to 
owners corporations in unit  titled properties.  
Cat containment laws 
If you own , or are considering getting , a cat, be aware that t he ACT Government has 
introduced cat containment requirements across the ACT for all cats born from 1 July 2022. 
A number of suburbs ha ve already  been declared cat containment areas , which means all 
cats in these areas, regardless of age, must be contained.Cats born  before  1 July 2022  do 
not have to be contained, unless they live in one of the declared cat containment suburbs . 
Containment means keeping your cat on your premises 24 hours a day.  This can 
include your house or apartment, an enclosed area in a bac kyard or courtyard, or a cat 
crate.  You are permitted to take your cat away from the property if they are in a cage or 
vehicle or on a harness and lead.  
There are a number of ways cats can be kept to their owner's premises and still be able to 
explore. Ca ts can be kept indoors or go outdoors in a purpose built enclosure which allows 
them to explore the outdoors without the risk of roaming.  
If you think you will need to make modifications or changes  to your rental property in order to 
appropriately contain  your cat, refer to the section on modifications  for more information 
about how you may be able to obtain permission from your landlord to do this. Be aware that 
if you are in a  unit complex , the maintenance of the balcony area may be the respo nsibility of 
the owners ’ corporation and you r landlord  may need to seek permission from the owners ’ 
corporation if you wish to make any modifications on the balcony.  53 
 For more information about cat containment laws in the ACT visit : 
https://www.city services.act.gov.au/pets -and-wildlife/domestic -animals/cats/cat -containment   
 
SUBLETTING  
Subletting is when you (as the tenant) allow someone else (other than a child or domestic 
partner) who is not named on the lease to live in all or part of the property , regardless of 
whether you stay living there or not. This does not apply to having short -term, non-paying 
guests visit.  
You are not allowed to sublet  the property without the written permission of the 
landlord . The landlord has the right to know (and to approve) who is living in the property.  
Subletting without permission is a ground for the landlord to seek to terminate your 
agreement.   
Further, the subletting arrangement will be legally unenforceable, meaning  the person to 
whom the property is sublet will not have any rights as a tenant.  
If you wish to sublet the property, m ake sure you get your landlord’s agreement in  writing . 
This may be in any form (e.g. via email or mobile phone message ), but make sure to keep a 
copy of the record in case there is any dispute later on.  
The agreement should be as specific  as possible  about the identity of the person to whom 
you are subletting and the key terms (e.g. for how long and whether you will still  be living in 
the property).  
  54 
 SHARE HOUSING OR  “CO-TENANCIES”  
Living  in a share house can be a great way to share the costs and responsibilities of renting 
as well as making life more social.  Share housing can be different from other tenancies 
though, as it can be more transient, with people moving in and out of the house over time.  
It may seem that these arrangements are informal but the reality is that legal rules do apply 
when people move i n and out. You need to know these rules because not following the m 
correctly may cause disputes and result in significant costs. You may want to consider these 
rules before setting up, or moving into a share house, so you and your other housemates 
can agre e on how you want your house to operate.  
In any situation where there is more than one tenant listed on the agreement , each tenant will 
be known as a ‘co -tenant’ and the agreement can be called a ‘co-tenancy .’   
What are my rights and responsibilities as a co -tenant?  
In a co -tenancy, you all share the same rights and obligations under the lease towards the 
landlord. This means that you all have the security and stability that comes with having the 
legal right to live in the property  as a tenant : a co -tenant can’t be made to leave the property 
unless the lease allows it. However, being a tenant also comes with responsibilities , and all 
co-tenants are equally responsible for the property under the law. This means that i f one co -
tenant brea ches the agreement, the other co -tenants are liable to the landlord for the 
breach . For example, if one co -tenant stops paying rent or damages the property, the landlord 
may seek to have the other co -tenants pay the outstanding rent or pay for the property  
damage.  
While it may be unlikely  that you end up having to pay for something your housemate did (or 
didn’t) do, be aware that t his is part of the risk you assume when deciding to live with others 
in a co -tenancy.  
An advantage of a co -tenancy is that the l aw clearly regulates your relationship, through the 
rules outlined in this section of the Renting Book.  
How do I become a co -tenant?  
Where you are one of several tenants under a residential tenancy agreement, you are all 
called co -tenants.  
You are a co -tenant if:    
 you are part of the original group starting up the share house, and your name is on the 
lease, or  
 you join an existing sh are house, and you follow the correct process to join as a 
co-tenant .  
Are there any other options?  
It is possible for you to live in a share house without being a co-tenant, as the law also 
recognises other types of arrangements. In particular, you could be a head tenant or 
sub-tenant, or have a ‘licence’ to live in the property. These alternatives to co-tenanc ies are 
outlined at the end of this section of the Renting Book. They have advantages and 
disadvantages, depending on what is important to you.  55 
 It is important that you know your legal status  at the beginning when you move into a 
share house, as this can significantly affect your legal rights and obligations.  
Key Points  
These are the key points you should know about how the law regulates share hou ses that 
are co -tenancies:  
 If a person wants to move out of a share house they MUST request the consent of 
the other housemates and of the landlord.  
 If a person moves out without consent , they may face significant costs because 
they will still be part of the tenancy agreement  down the track (e.g. if damage is 
caused to the property after they leave) . 
 There are rules about whether the landlord and other housemates can refuse consent  to 
some one moving out . In short:  
❖ Any of the housemates or the landlord can refuse a person moving out during a 
fixed term  agreement  for any reason . 
❖ The housemates or the landlord can only refuse a person moving out during a 
periodic agreement  if this is reasonabl e and if they obtain an ACAT order 
endorsing the refusal.  
❖ Any of the housemates can refuse a new person moving in  for any reason . 
❖ The landlord can only refuse a new person moving in if this is reasonable.  
 If the housemates and/or the landlord disagree abou t a person moving in or out, the 
dispute may be taken to ACAT for an independent decision.  
 If the consent processes are properly followed, then people can move in and out of the 
share house without terminating the tenancy agreement with the landlord. The original 
agreement is treated as continuing, just with different tenants. This is good news 
because it means that:  
❖ new condition reports do not  need to be done , and  
❖ the landlord or agent cannot require the tenants to move out or undergo 
additional inspec tions  just because the housemates in the share house are 
changing.  
 Landlords must not require or accept any money for consenting to requests for people to 
move in and out of the share house.  
 If a new person moves in without the consent process being followed:  
❖ that person will have no rights as a tenant under the law, an d  
❖ the other housemates will be in breach of their agreement . As with unlawful 
subletting, having a new person move in without seeking the landlord’s consent is 
a ground for the landlord to seek to terminate the lease.  
 BOND - When people move in and out, t he housemates are responsible for dealing 
with the bond.  
❖ The housemates work out whether the person leaving owes any money (e .g. for 
unpaid rent or damage) and deduct this from their share of the bond.  56 
 ❖ The person moving in pays their share of the bond to t he housemates (or to the 
person leaving, as the case may be).  
❖ The housemates must notify the ACT Revenue Office of the changes in the share 
house, so that the legal record of who is a party to the bond can be updated.     
 If a legal dispute about any aspec t of the tenancy arises between the housemates, or 
between the landlord and the housemates, and it can’t be resolved, the dispute can be 
taken to ACAT for independent resolution.   
CHANGING HOUSEMATES  
A housemate wants to move out  (leaving a co-tenancy)  
It is part of life in a share house that for various reasons people may want to move on. 
However, the decision of one housemate to move out affects the interests of the other 
housemates as well as of the landlord. Because of this, the law requi res the leaving 
housemate to ask for their consent before they can end their co -tenancy and move out.  
 The housemate who wants to leave must seek consent in writing from the landlord 
and the other housemates.  
 The housemate must give a minimum of 21 days’ notice before they plan to move 
out (in practice, of course, the more notice the better.)  
 There is no particular form required to seek consent as long as it is in writing (e.g. the 
housemate could seek consent via email, text message, social media etc ).  
 All parties should keep records of their messages to each other.  
 If there is more than one other housemate, a response is required from each housemate. 
This does not mean that each person must reply separately, but if one housemate 
replies on behalf of some  or all of the others, this should be made clear in the response.  
What happens if a housemate moves out without seeking consent?  
Their liability under the tenancy agreement  does not end  and they may be responsible to 
cover their share of the rent until the end of the agreement. See - What happens if ACAT 
approves the other parties refusing consent?  
Can the landlord or other housemates refuse consent?  
The way the consent process works depends on whether the housemate is proposing to 
leave during a fixed term or a periodic agreement. Basically, it is easier to leave during a 
periodic tenancy (this is consistent with the g eneral position at law that it is easier to end 
periodic tenancies than fixed  term tenancies).  
If you are in doubt about whether your tenancy is fixed term or periodic, see the information 
in Starting Your Tenancy . 57 
 Consent process for housemate moving out  
Type of agreement  Can the other parties refuse consent?  
The housemate wants 
to move out during a 
fixed term 
agreement.  
 The landlord or the other housemates can refuse consent for any 
(lawful) reason . For example, if one housemate thinks they will not 
be able to afford the rent on their own if the other housemate moves 
out and does not want to live with someone else.  
 
If the landlord or one of the other housemates refuses consent, the 
co-tenant who wants to move out may apply to ACAT for an order 
permitting them to do so.  
 
The housemate wants 
to move out during a 
periodic agreement.  
 The landlord or the other housemates ca n only refuse consent if :  
 
˃ it is reasonable for them to do so, and 
˃ they apply for  (and obtain) an order from ACAT allowing 
them to refuse consent.  
 
If the landlord or any of the other housemates want to refuse 
consent , they have to apply to ACAT within 21 days of receiving 
the co -tenant’s request to move out.  
 
If the application to ACAT is not made within 21 days, the landlord or 
other housemate/s are taken to have consented.  
 
ACAT will decide whether the person who r efused consent to the 
housemate moving out was acting reasonably.  
 
Example  
Keira, Manon and Aley are  housemates  on a periodic tenancy 
agreement . They agree at the start of  December  that they will all 
move out at the end of January . However, Aley then decides she 
wants to move out early and she asks Keira and Manon to consent 
to her leaving at the end of December. Keira and Manon don’t want 
to consent to this , as it will mean they ne ed to cover the rent 
between the two of them until the end of January and because it will 
be difficult for them to find a replacement tenant for just a few weeks. 
Keira and Manon apply to ACAT for an order requesting permission 
to refuse consent to Aley’s request to leave the tenancy.   
 
What  happens if consent is grante d?  
If: 
 the landlord and the other housemates grant consent , or  
 ACAT makes an order approving the housemate leaving,  58 
 then the housemate can move out and the residential tenancy agreement continues 
between the landlord and the remaining housemates.     
The housemate’s rights and obligations as a co -tenant under the residential tenancy 
agreement will end on the day that they move out (or another date agreed by the parties or 
ordered  by ACAT). In particular, from that date the housemate is no longer liable to pay rent 
or for any damage to the property. The continuing housemates will also need to make 
arrangements to pay out the leaving housemate’s share of the bond (see more on this 
below).  
What if the landlord or the other housemates don’t respond to the request for 
consent?  
If the landlord or any of the other housemates do not respond within 21 days  of receiving 
the request for consent, they are taken to have consented . 
The housemate who is seeking consent should try (within reason) to make sure that the 
landlord and the other housemates have received the request.  
What happens if ACAT approves the ot her parties refusing consent?  
If the residential tenancy agreement is for a fixed term , and the housemate cannot obtain 
consent to move out (even after taking the dispute to ACAT), they can still move out in 
practice. However, they will remain legally liab le for their obligations as a co -tenant under the 
agreement for the rest of the fixed term, unless they negotiate a different outcome with their 
landlord and/or housemates. In this circumstance, the other parties will be under a general 
duty to mitigate th eir losses, in particular by trying to find a new co -tenant  or by accepting the 
extra cost associated with the outgoing tenant leaving (if they do not want to find a 
replacement tenant) . 
If the residential tenancy agreement is periodic,  and ACAT has made a n order refusing 
consent for the housemate to move out, then the housemate can still move out, but they 
would need to issue a new ‘notice of intention to vacate’ giving the landlord 21 days ’ notice 
of their intention to leave the tenancy.  L egally the effe ct of this would  be to end the entire 
tenancy agreement for all of the remaining housemates. The landlord and the remaining 
housemates would need to sign a new agreement (and finalise a new condition report etc). If 
this doesn’t happen, but the remaining housemates stay on and keep paying rent, it’s very 
likely that a  new tenancy will be implied.   
In practice, the housemate who wants to leave may wish to discuss these options with the 
remaining co -tenants and the landlord early to decide whether it would be better to issue a 
notice of intention to vacate (ending the t enancy agreement for all parties) or if it is better to 
seek the consent of the other parties for the leaving housemate  to move out and allow the 
agreement to continue for the remaining housemates . 
Example: Kelly wants to move out of her share house  
Peter,  Saffron, and Kelly are co -tenants, and Jasper is their landlord. They have a fixed term 
tenancy with 8 months still remaining in the fixed term. Kelly would like to leave the tenancy 
as she would like to accept a job in Queensland. Kelly seeks consent in writing from Peter, 
Saffron, and Jasper, giving them 21 days notice in writing before the date that she would like 
to move out.  59 
 Any one of Peter, Saffron or Jasper may refuse consent for any lawful reason, and Peter 
chooses to exercise this right (while t he others consent). Peter refuses because he is 
concerned that he will not be able to afford an increase in his rent if he and Saffron can’t find 
a replacement tenant for Kelly.  
Kelly applies to the ACAT for an order that she may leave the tenancy. ACAT di rects 
everyone to attend mediation, and the parties voluntarily come to an agreement that they will 
consent following a pathway similar to a ‘break lease fee clause’ situation, meaning that 
Kelly will cover the rent for a period, giving Peter and Saffron t ime to find a new tenant.  
A new person wants to move in  (Joining a co-tenancy)  
Great! You’ve found a suitable new housemate. If someone new wants to move into the 
property as a co -tenant, the following rules apply.  
 One of the existing housemates must seek consent in writing from the landlord 
and from any other housemates.  
 The housemate seeking consent on behalf of the new person must give a 
minimum of 14  days’ notice before the new person wants to move in.  (In practice, of 
course, the more notice the better .) 
 There is no particular form required to seek consent as long as it is in writing e.g. the 
housemate could seek consent via email, text message, etc.  
 All parties should keep records of their messages to each other.  
 If there is more than one other housem ate, a response is required from each housemate. 
This does not mean that each person must reply separately, but if one housemate 
replies on behalf of some or all of the others, this should be made clear in the response.  
 If a new person moves in without the  consent process being followed:  
❖ that person will have no rights as a tenant under the law, and  
❖ the other housemates will be in breach of their agreement . As with unlawful 
subletting, having a new person move in without seeking the landlord’s consent is 
a ground for the landlord to seek to end the lease.  
Can the landlord or other housemates refuse consent?  
The rules on consent are different for the landlord and the other housemates.  60 
 Can the other parties refuse consent to a new person moving in?  
Landlord  The landlord  can only refuse consent if  it is reasonable for 
them to do so . 
 
If they refuse consent, the landlord must provide their reasons 
in writing to the housemate seeking consent and the new person.  
 
The housemate seeking consent may apply for  an order from 
ACAT approving the new person moving in ( as long as the 
other housem ates have consented and it is only the landlord who 
has not).  
 
The new person can move in as a co -tenant from the date 
this application is made.  
 
ACAT will decide whether the landlord’s decision was reasonable.  
 
Other housemates  
 Any other housemate can  refuse consent for any (lawful) 
reason.   
 
This is because the law recognises that the other housemates 
should have a say in who they live with and should not be forced 
to live with a new co -tenant if they do not wish to.  
 
 
These rules are the same for fixed term and periodic tenancies.  
These rules do not apply to share houses in crisis accommodation or social housing 
(see below for the rules in these situations).  
What happens if consent is granted?  
If:  
 the other housemates and the landlord consent, or  
 ACAT makes an order preventing the landlord from refusing consent,  
then the existing tenancy will continue with the new person as a co -tenant.   
The date the new person becomes a co -tenant will be either: the date they move in, the date 
that the application (if any) to ACAT challenging the landlord’s refusal is made, or another 
date agreed between the parties or ordered by ACAT.  
What if the landlord or the other housemates don’t respond to the request for 
consent?  
If the landlord or any of the other housemates  do not respond within 14 days after 
receiving the request for consent , they are taken to have consented . This rule is designed 
to ensure that the landlord or other housemates cannot prevent someone new  from moving 
in simply by ignoring the request.  61 
 The housemate who is seeking consent on behalf of the new person should try (within 
reason) to make sure that the landlord and the other housemates have received the request.  
What is the process for challeng ing the landlord’s refusal to consent in ACAT?  
If the other housemates consent but the landlord does not, the housemate seeking consent 
can apply for an ACAT order to approve the incoming co -tenant moving in. This is known as a 
‘declaration application ’.  
The incoming co -tenant will be able to move in from the date of the ACAT application 
and becomes a co -tenant from that date . They will need to pay rent and bond from this 
date and will also need to be given a copy of the condition report. This approach rec ognises 
that the ACAT process may take time to resolve and it may be difficult for the new 
housemate to make other temporary housing arrangements while waiting for the outcome.  
ACAT must decide whether the landlord acted reasonably in refusing consent.  ACAT 
will take into account all of the circumstances, but under the law it must consider whether:  
 The property would be overcrowded if the new person were to move in.  
 The new person is listed on a residential tenancy database (for further information see 
the section on tenancy databases ). 
 The new person is suitable for the tenancy, if the tenancy exists for a particular purpose. 
For example, it may be reasonable for a landlord operating a housing support program 
for women at risk of homelessness, or men leaving prison, to refuse consent to a new 
person who is not within this class of people.  
 The property is provided by an employer in connection with a person’s employment, in 
which case it may be reasonable to only permit employees to live there.  
ACAT can also take into account other matters  that it considers relevant.  
It is expected that landlords will only withhold consent where there are genuine, objective 
reasons for doing so, rather than mere personal preferences. Landlords should also not 
unreasonably withhold consent in exchange for be nefits (e.g. an increase in rent).  
If ACAT decides that the landlord’s decision to refuse consent was unreasonable, then the 
new person continues being a co -tenant and may remain in the property.  
If ACAT finds that the landlord’s decision to refuse consen t was reasonable, then the new 
person will stop being a co -tenant and must leave the property within 21  days . 
Note : the law provides procedural protections for landlords in the event that a housemate 
applies to ACAT, thereby making the new person a co -tenant, and then withdraws the 
application (which would technically prevent ACAT from deciding the matter). In that event, 
the landlord can apply for an order that the new person must stop being a co -tenant and 
leave the property.  
Example: Aparna wants to move  into the share house  
Rafael, Mai, and Rami are co -tenants, and James is their landlord. The housemates would 
all like Aparna to join the tenancy.  Any one of Rafael, Mai, or Rami may seek consent from 
the others and from James, so Rafael takes on that tas k. Rafael seeks consent in writing for 62 
 Aparna to join the tenancy, giving the others at least 14 days to respond before she 
proposes to move in.  
Mai and Rami may refuse consent for any lawful reason, but on this occasion they reply in 
writing within 14  days to confirm their consent.  
James must not unreasonably refuse consent. He wishes to refuse consent. He provides his 
refusal and reasons in writing (as he is required to do). He says that his reason is because 
he is worried about overcrowding in the proper ty. 
Rafael, Mai, and Rami disagree that the property would be overcrowded as it has four 
bedrooms and two bathrooms. As Mai and Rami have both consented, Rafael applies to 
ACAT for an order that James’ refusal was unreasonable. ACAT must consider if the pr operty 
would be overcrowded with Aparna as a co -tenant.  
Aparna becomes a co -tenant and can move in on the day that Rafael makes the application 
to ACAT.  
If ACAT considers that James’ refusal was reasonable, it may order that Aparna is to stop 
being a part y to the residential tenancy agreement, and Aparna will have to leave the 
property within 21 days of the order.   
If ACAT considers that James’ refusal was unreasonable, it can make a declaration to this 
effect. In this case, ACAT orders that James was unre asonable to refuse, having regard to 
the size of the property and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Aparna will remain a 
co-tenant  and can continue living at the property . 
What are the rules for new people moving into social housing or crisis 
accommoda tion?  
A new person can only move in as a co -tenant to a share house that is in social housing or 
declared crisis accommodation if the other co -tenants and the landlord agree. This means 
that rules in relation to challenging the landlord’s refusal to conse nt to a new housemate do 
not apply in relation to social housing or crisis accommodation. This is to ensure that social 
housing and crisis accommodation can continue to be allocated on a needs basis.  
Social housing means Government -provided housing (throu gh Housing ACT) or housing 
provided by a registered community housing provider under a Government -approved 
program.  
CHANGES IN HOUSEMATES: WHAT ABOUT THE 
BOND ? 
Key point: the housemates must work out the bond  
When there is a change of housemates in the sha re house:  
 There is no need for the bond to be paid out and then repaid by all the co -tenants.  
 This is because  the original tenancy with the landlord is continuing, just with different 
co-tenants, and so the original bond remains valid.  63 
  The housemates must  work out among themselves how much should be paid to 
any outgoing housemate, and how much must be paid by any incoming 
housemate.   
 This includes working out whether the person leaving is responsible for any damage to 
the property.  
This system is designed to allow the housemates to manage their liabilities privately, without 
the agent or landlord becoming involved. Importantly, this means:  
 Landlords or agents cannot require the housemates to move out and then move back in 
again befo re a new person can move in.  
 Landlords or agents cannot insist on:  
❖ doing an inspection of the property, or  
❖ requiring a new condition report  
as a condition of agreeing to a person moving in or out. The landlord or agent need only 
do a final inspection and  condition report at the end of the tenancy, when everyone is 
moving out.  
 The remaining housemates (and any new housemate) will be liable for any damage 
done to the property by outgoing housemates.  
In practice, if the housemates are concerned about damage to the property by an outgoing 
housemate, they have the option of repairing the damage at that time, using the money 
deducted from the bond payment to the outgoing housemate (such that it will no longer be a 
bond issue down the track). An example is provid ed below of how this might work.  
The rules that the housemates must follow in managing the bond are set out below. These 
rules apply equally to fixed term and periodic tenancies.  
A housemate is moving out  
 The other housemates must pay the person leaving th eir share of the bond (within 
14 days of the person moving out) but may deduct any money reasonably owing 
by the person.  
 This includes any unpaid rent or the cost of any damage the person has caused to the 
property that would ordinarily come out of the bo nd (i.e. damage that is not just fair wear 
and tear).  
 The other housemates must then notify the ACT Revenue Office  that the person is 
leaving and has been paid their share of the bond.  
 The ACT Revenue Office will then ensure that the person who has moved out is no 
longer recorded as having any interest in the bond.  
 If there is a dispute between the housemates about how much the person leaving should 
be paid out, the person leaving can a pply to ACAT to resolve the dispute (this can still be 
done after they have moved out).   
 The housemates should keep written records of the payment made and the reasons for 
any deductions, as well as the notification to the ACT Revenue Office.  64 
 A new housem ate is moving in  
 The new housemate must pay to the other housemates their share of the bond 
within 14 days of moving in.  
 The new housemate must notify the ACT Revenue Office  that they have moved in 
and paid their share of the bond.  
 The ACT Revenue Office w ill then ensure that the person who has moved in is recorded 
as having an interest in the bond.  
 The housemates should keep written records of the payment made as well as the 
notification to the ACT Revenue Office.  
 The new housemate must be given a copy of  the original condition report  no later 
than the day after they move in.  
 The new housemate will become liable for damage done to the property by 
existing or former housemates.  Because of this , they should review the original 
condition report carefully and compare it to the existing condition of the property.  If the 
new housemate thinks that there has been damage to the property since the tenancy 
commenced (that has not been accounted for in the amount of bond they were asked to 
pay when moving in) they sho uld raise this with the existing housemates.  
 If there is a dispute about how much money the new housemate is being asked to 
pay in bond, this dispute can be taken to ACAT.  
Help! What if my sharehouse is ending but my name isn’t on the bond record?  
Sometimes a share house can last for years with multiple changes in housemates, and 
everyone loses track of who owned the dusty boxes in the garage. It can happen that when 
the share house is being dissolved (the entire tenancy is ending), and it comes tim e to pay 
out the bond, the names of the tenants in the share house at that time do not match 
ACT Revenue’s Office records about who has an interest in the bond.  
In that case, the ACT Revenue Office will refer the matter to ACAT. ACAT will determine who 
is entitled to be paid out a share of the bond. This ensures that if the housemates at some 
point have failed to notify the ACT Revenue Office about people moving in and out of the 
share house, the problem can be fixed and the bond can be paid out correctly.  
Example: Jonah is moving out and Azima is moving in. How do they manage 
the bond?  
Jonah lives in a share house with Margot and Yuko as co -tenants. They paid a bond at the 
beginning of their tenancy of $3600, in equal shares of $1200 each. Jonah has decide d to 
move out, and he will be replaced in the house by Margot’s friend Azima. The landlord and all 
the housemates have consented in writing to these changes.  
A while ago, Jonah damaged the wall in his bedroom while moving furniture. The housemates 
agree th at the significant chips in the wall are not fair wear and tear and will likely be deducted 
from their bond at the end of the tenancy when everyone moves out.  
Before Jonah moves out, he arranges a quote from a painter for patching and painting the 
damaged wall. The quote is for $200.  65 
 Within 14 days of Jonah moving out, Margot and Yuko pay him $1000 (his share of the bond 
less the estimated cost of the damage to the wall).  
Margot and Yuko then have two choices:  
1. Within 14 days of moving in, Azima pays Margo t and Yuko $1200 as her share of the 
bond. Margot and Yuko recoup their payment to Jonah and use the additional $200 to 
pay for the tradesperson to fix the wall.  The housemates notify the ACT Revenue 
Office that Jonah has moved out and Azima has moved in,  so that the official bond 
record can be updated.   
OR 
2. Within 14 days of moving in, Azima pays Margot and Yuko $1000 as her share of the 
bond (or Margot and Yuko agree to Azima paying this money directly to Jonah). Azima 
is aware that at the end of the ten ancy, when a deduction is made for damage to the 
property, the $200 would likely be deducted from the bond and that when the bond is 
paid out, she would receive $1000, while Margot and Yuko would receive $1200 each 
from the total bond (assuming no addition al deductions are required). The housemates 
notify the ACT Revenue Office that Jonah has moved out and Azima has moved in, so 
that the official bond record can be updated.   
DISPUTES BETWEEN HOUSEMATES: GOING TO 
ACAT  
If major disputes (relating to right and obligations under the tenancy agreement) arise 
between housemates in a share house that cannot be resolved amicably, any one of the 
housemates can take the dispute to ACAT and seek orders in relation to bond or an order 
that one of t he other housemates should be removed as a co -tenant from the tenancy 
agreement. In effect, this means the person will be required to move out.  
This is a serious step. This ability to apply to ACAT might be used, for example, if one 
housemate is jeopardis ing the entire tenancy agreement because they are repeatedly not 
paying their share of rent or intentionally damaging the property, or using the premises for 
illegal activities.  
ACAT will usually direct the housemates to attend mediation, and will always h ear from all of 
the housemates (who wish to participate in the proceedings) before making any final 
decision.  
Remember, housemates can always seek legal advice  before going to ACAT.  
WHAT IF I’M NOT A CO -TENANT ? 
The rules discussed above apply to share houses that are co-tenancies. However,  you can 
set up or join a share house without being (or becoming) a co-tenant. The main alternatives 
are briefly mentioned here.  66 
 Your legal status is impor tant, so it is best to have clear records in writing at the beginning, 
when you move into the share house, that show what you and other housemates  and the 
landlord intend your status to be.  
If you think your living arrangement may fall into one of these al ternative categories, and you 
are unsure about your rights and obligations, you should seek legal advice.  
Head tenant / sub -tenant  
If one person has their name on the lease and assumes all the responsibilities of the tenancy 
towards the landlord, and the n rents out rooms in the property to others, this person 
becomes a “head tenant” and the other residents are “sub -tenants”. This is called sub -letting.  
The head tenant can only sub -let if the landlord consents in writing.  Failure to seek 
the landlord’s consent is a breach of the residential tenancy agreement and the 
landlord may seek to end the tenancy.  The person who moves in under an 
unauthorised subletting arrangement will have no rights as a tenant and may be 
evicted.  
Provided the subletting is authorised by the landlord, then being the head tenant means you 
get to choose the sub -tenants. However, b eing a head tenant carries significant 
responsibilities. The head tenant is basically a landlord towards the sub -tenants.  The 
head tenant must comply with all the rights and obligations of a landlord under the Act (e.g. 
collecting  and paying rent on time , depositing the sub -tenants’ bond payments, arranging 
(through the main landlord) for repairs to be done, etc).  
The sub -tenants have no legal relationship with the main landlord (only with the head 
tenant). This means that if one of the sub -tenants breaches  the residential tenancy 
agreement (e.g.  stops paying rent  or damages the property ), then the head tenant is 
ultimately liable for this breach to the main landlord.  
Being a  sub-tenant means  you are not liable for the actions of the head tenant or other 
housemates.  However, there are possible  disadvantages. For example, if the head tenant 
moves out, then any sub -tenancies will automatically end.  To remain in the property, the 
sub-tenant would need to start a new tenancy agreement with the main landlord or an other 
person as head tenant.  Also, t he head tenant could potentially seek to end your tenancy if 
they have a lawful reason to do so (the grounds for  ending  tenancies are discussed later in 
the Renting Book).   
Occupants  
An occupant is someone who pays money  for the right to live in a property as their home , 
but who is not a tenant and their accommodation instead falls within one of several 
categories. The categories of occupancy typically include:  
 people living in the owner’s home while the owner also lives there  
 student accommodation on (or associated with) the campus of an educational institution  
 people renting a bedroom in shared properties where facilities or domestic services are 
provided to the residents  67 
  some types of emergency or crisis accommoda tion, or accommodation provided under a 
housing support program  
 accommodation provided through a club of which the person is a member, and  
 accommodation (or site rental) in a residential park.  
Occupan cy agreements are subject to a different legal framework  to residential tenancy 
agreements  and so the Renting Book does not apply. Instead, there are specific  provisions 
under the Act  that set out the rights and obligations of occupants.  
Note:  it is not possible to have an occupancy agreement that sits under a  residential tenancy 
agreement (i.e. a tenant cannot set up an occupancy agreement instead of a co -tenancy or 
sub-tenancy).  
Licensees  
A person who is paying money for their accommodation (e.g. a room in a house), but is not a 
tenant or occupant, will usual ly be what is known as a ‘licensee’. The term comes from the 
idea that the person has a legal ‘licence’ to live in the property because of the contractual 
arrangement reached between them and the person who owns or controls the property.  
Being a licensee may be suitable for people who want very short term or flexible 
accommodation. However, a licensee has no rights under residential tenancy law  or 
occupancy law, and so they tend to have little control over their living arrangements – for 
example, they are vulnerable to increases in costs and to eviction. Licensees are not 
covered by residential tenancy law and so the Renting Book does not apply.  
  68 
 DISPUTES AND BREACHES OF THE 
AGREEMENT  
This section of the Renting Book discusses what m ight happen if either a tenant or landlord 
breaches (fails to comply with) the residential tenancy agreement. For example:  
 the landlord does not  carry out repairs or the prop erty does not compl y with the ceiling 
insulation standard as required under the Act  
 the landlord frequently attends the property without notice or consent from the tenant  
e.g. to do gardening  or to conduct an inspection  
 the landlord has refused requests to make modifications to the property or to keep a pet, 
without the approval of ACAT  
 the tenant  fails to pay rent  on time  
 the tenant causes significant damage to the property  
 the tenant has a  pet without asking the landlord for  consent, if the agreement requires 
that consent  be requested ,  
 the tenant unlawfully sub -lets the property (without the landlord’s consent)  
 the tenant continually interferes with the quiet enjoyment of their neighbours, or 
 the tenant is breaching the owners corporation rules in an apartment building . 
If the  tenant and landlord cannot resolve the  breach, it can lead to the residential tenancy 
agreement  being ended .  
There are a number of ways in which a residential tenancy agreement can end  without  there 
being any breach  of the agreement . These are discussed in the next section on ‘Ending Your 
Tenancy’.   
For both tenants and landlords, y ou should always consider getting legal advice  before 
taking steps to end a tenancy , especially for a breach . Be aware that the other party can take  
the dispute to ACAT . You could be liable for compensation if  ACAT decides that there has not 
been any breach of the agreement or if  the correct  procedures to end a tenanct were not 
followed . 
The rules outlined in this section apply to both fixed term and periodic tena ncies.  
LANDLORD IN BREACH: OPTIONS FOR TENANTS  
If you think that your landlord is  breach ing your  residential tenancy agreement , you r main 
options as a tenant  are as follows : 
 Try to resolve the dispute  informally by communicating with your landlord or real estate 
agent to reach an agreed outcome . 69 
  Apply to ACAT  for an order reducing your rent temporarily to compensate you for the 
breach . 
 Issue a formal notice to the landlord requiring them to fix the bre ach within two weeks . 
This is called a ‘notice to remedy ’. If the landlord doesn ’t fix the breach, your options are:  
❖ apply to ACAT for an order that the breach be addressed (this is called a 
‘performance order’) and that you are paid compensation , or 
❖ if the breach is serious enough and you want to move out of the property, you 
may then issue a ‘notice of intention to vacate ’. This allows you to end the 
tenancy within a further two weeks.  Note – the landlord may decide to challenge 
this if they believe the breach is not serious enough.  
 In exceptional circumstances, i f the breach is serious enough, you can apply to ACAT for 
an order to end  the tenancy.  
 If you are on a periodic tenancy and you wish to leave the property, you have an 
additi onal option: you can always end your agreement by giving 3  weeks’ notice to the 
landlord (see further below the section ‘Ending Your Tenancy’).  
You may end up using more than one of these options . 
Resolving disputes by  agreement  
Discussing the issue with your landlord or agent will usually be the best option  initially . Many 
issues can be resolved constructively this way, provided that both parties can communicate 
respectfully.  
If you and your landlord or agent agree on any actions to resolve the dispute, make sure 
these are recorded in writing (e.g. via email) so that both parties are clear about next steps . 
Such records  may also be needed later as evidence if another dispute occurs.  
Rent reductions by order of ACAT  
If you are interested in this option, see the information on rent reductions  above.  Remember 
the basic point is that an ACAT  order is needed for this option: you cannot just decide to 
withhold rent  – if you do , you will be in breach of your agreement and your landlord may 
seek to evict you. 
Issuing a notice to remedy  / notice to vacate  
If more informal methods have not worked or are not appropriate, and you are not interested 
in a rent reduction , you can issue a notice to remedy  to your landlord.  
The notice to remedy is basically a formal letter  that gives the landlord two weeks  to fix the 
breach  of the residential tenancy agreement  (if it is capable of being fixed).  
 You cannot give your landlord less than two weeks  to remedy a breach , but you could 
give a longer timefra me at your discretion.  
 Your notice to remedy must clearly identify what the breach is and what needs to be 
done to fix it.  70 
 The main aim of the notice to remedy is to get the breach  fixed (e.g. to get the necessary 
repair finalised)  so that you don’t need  to leave the property . However, it is also a step you 
must take before you can end the tenancy  because of the breach  (assuming the breach  is 
serious enough to justify ending the tenancy ): you cannot give a notice of intention to vacate 
unless you have first given a notice to remedy . 
If your landlord fixes the breach within the two week period, your tenancy continues . 
You cannot  choose to vacate the property anyway.  
If your landlord does not fix the breach within two week s (or if the breach is not capabl e 
of being fixed), you can then issue a notice of intention to vacate  if the breach is serious 
enough to justify moving out . The notice to vacate is basically a formal letter  that tells the 
landlord you will be leaving the property.  
 Your notice to vacate  must state the date on which the tenancy will end (the date you will 
move out) . 
 You must give two weeks ’ notice at a minimum (you could give more notice if you wish).   
 You must  keep  paying rent to th e date you leave the property .  
If your landlord fixes the breach within the two week period from the date of your notice of 
intention to vacate, you can choose whether you want to stay in the property and continue 
the tenancy, or  you can  terminate your tenancy  from the date stated in your notice. 
Make  sure to let your landlord or agent know your decision.  
Some general tips for both notices to remedy and notices  of intention  to vacate:  
 Notices do not have to be in any particular form . The Tenancy Advice Service ACT 
makes sample notices available on its w ebsite that you may wish to use: 
https://www.legalaidact.org.au/tasact .  
 Make sure you use your best  efforts so that you will be able to prove that the landlord or 
agent  received your notice. Check your residential tenancy agreement which will have an 
address for you to serve notices on  your landlord or agent  and make sure you (use that 
address , otherwise your notice may not be properly served under the law  
 If you go down the route of issuing these notices to your landlord, there is no need for 
you to get an order from ACAT terminating your tenancy . Your tenancy will end on 
the date specified in  your notice of intention to vacate. There is no need to pay a ‘break 
lease’ fee or compensation to your landlord if you terminate your tenancy in these 
circumstances.  
 However, be aware that y our landlord may challenge your  notice /s in ACAT if they 
disagr ee that there has been any breach of the agreement  or if they think that it is 
not serious enough to justify ending the tenancy .  
Applying to ACAT for an order to end the tenancy   
You can apply to ACAT to end your agreement without first issuing a notice to remedy to the 
landlord. ACAT will only make an order if it is satisfied that  the breach is serious enough to 71 
 justify ending the tenancy . ACAT can order that the landlord remedy the b reach  instead of  
ending  the agreement. You may wish to seek legal advice  before pursuing an ACAT order.  
TENANT  IN BREACH  
Tenant  in breach:  failure to pay rent  
If you cannot pay your rent, consider speaking with your landlord or agent as soon as 
possible. You may be able to negotiate a payment agreement to allow you to catch up on 
your arrears. Make sure you record any agreement in writing.  
If you fail to pay rent, your landlord may take steps to make you pay the outstanding rent or 
to end the tenancy  if you do not pay . There is a process that the landlord must follow . 
The key steps are:  
Notice to remedy  
 The landlord must first issue you a wr itten notice to remedy  requiring you to pay the 
outstanding rent . The landlord can only give you this notice after the rent has been 
unpaid for one week.  The notice should state how much rent is owing.  
 If you pay the outstanding rent within 7 days  of recei ving the notice , then the landlord 
may not take  further action and your tenancy will continue. The notice must tell you  this. 
Note that if your landlord has previously given you two notices to remedy in relation to 
unpaid rent, and you fail to pay rent a t hird time, then your landlord does not need to issue a 
further notice to remedy and can simply issue you a notice to vacate after rent is unpaid for a 
week.  
If you do not agree that you are in arrears  (behind in your rent payments)  you can request a 
copy of your rent records.  
Notice to vacate / termination notice  
 If you do not pay the outstanding rent within 7 days, the landlord may serve you with a 
notice to vacate  that requires you  to leave the prope rty. This is also called a 
‘termination notice. ’  
 The landlord must give you a minimum of two weeks ’ notice  (from the date of the 
notice).  
 If you move out of the property, your tenancy ends  on the date you move out.  
❖ You will not owe any additional rent af ter you move out in accordance with a 
notice to vacate.   
❖ However, y our landlord may use the bond towards your unpaid rent.  
❖ If you owe more than the amount of bond (in rent or due to property damage) 
your landlord may seek an order from ACAT that you pay any amount exceeding 
the bond.  
 You may be liable for compensation to your landlord (in addition to the unpaid rent) if you 
do not comply with a valid notice to vacate.  72 
  If you do not move out of the property, your landlord can apply to ACAT for an 
order terminating the tenancy and requiring you to leave.  This type of order is called 
a ‘termination and possession order ’.  
 You cannot be made to leave a tenancy without an ACAT order  and ACAT has some 
discretion as to whether they make a termination and possession order  (see further 
below).  This means you may be able to stay in  your rental property (even though you 
have breached your  agreement) if ACAT considers it appropriate in the circumstances to 
let you stay.  
 
ACAT order  
You will be informed if your landlord makes an application to ACAT and you will receive a 
copy of their claim and have the opportunity to respond in ACAT.  
ACAT may decide to do one of the following:  
 make a termination and possession order, in which case your tenancy will be  
terminated  and you are required to move out on the date specified in the order ; 
 make a payment order which allows you to remain in the tenancy but  requir es you to 
pay the outstanding rent, if ACAT is satisfied that you are reasonably likely to make the 
payment ; or 
 if you have paid the outstanding rent, ACAT can decide not to make any order , if 
ACAT considers that you are reasonably likely to pay rent on time in future and that not 
making any order is just and appropriate.  
However, if you have repeatedly failed to pay your rent and your landlord has made more 
than 2 previous applications for a termination and possession ord er (for your failure to pay 
rent) in the past 12 -month period, ACAT can decide to make a payment order that you pay 
future rent as it falls due (even if you do not owe any rent at the time ACAT makes its order). 
To make a payment order ACAT must be satisfi ed that you are reasonably likely to comply 
with the order so you will need some evidence of your ongoing capacity to pay rent.   
If a payment order is made and you do not comply with it, your landlord can apply again to 
ACAT for a termination and possessi on order.   If you have breached a p ayment order your 
landlord doesn’t need to issue you with a new notice to remedy or notice to vacate before 
they apply back to ACAT  for a termination and posession order .  
If your tenancy is terminated, ACAT can also make  orders in relation to your bond. If you 
owe more money than the amount of your bond, ACAT can also make an order that you pay 
any outstanding amount to your landlord.  
Tenancy ended  by ACAT  
 If ACAT decides to end your tenancy by making a termination and possession order they 
can end the tenancy on the same day as the ACAT hearing or they can suspend the 
order to end your tenancy for up to 3 weeks .  73 
  In deciding how much time to give you before  your tenancy is ended ACAT will consider 
your situation and that of the landlord.  They cannot suspend the order for longer than 
3 weeks.  
Warrant for eviction through ACAT  
 If ACAT makes a termination and possession order, and you do not move out, your 
landlord may apply to ACAT for a warrant for your eviction, which can ultimately be 
enforced by the police.  
You should consider seeking legal advice if your landlord issues you with notices in 
relation to unpaid rent and you are not able to pay the rent.  
Other breaches by the tenant  
If your landlord thinks you have breached your residential tenancy agreement in any way 
other than a failure to pay rent,  (for example, you have caused considerable property 
damage or have engaged in repeated or serious anti-social behaviour towards your 
neighbours) your landlord may take steps to make you fix the breach, or end your tenancy if 
you do not.  The process is similar to th at outlined above for a failure to pay rent.   
 The landlord may issue you with a written notice to remedy  requiring you to fix the 
breach . You must be given at least  two weeks  to fix the breach . The notice should 
clearly state what the breach is  and what you must do to fix it . 
 If you fix the breach within two weeks (or otherwise come to an agr eement with your 
landlord about the dispute – make sure you get it in writing), then your tenancy will 
continue.  
 If you do not fix the breach within two weeks, your landlord may issue you a notice to 
vacate  which requires you to move out . This is also call ed a ‘termination notice’. You 
must be given  at least  two weeks ’ notice .  
 If you move out of the property  after receiving the notice to vacate  (and return the 
keys) , your tenancy is will end  on the date you move out.  
 If you do not move out of the property , your landlord can apply to ACAT for an order to 
end the tenancy. This type of order is called a ‘ termination and possession order ’.  
 You will be informed if your landlord makes an application to ACAT , receive a copy of the 
application  and you will have the opportunity to respond in ACAT.  
ACAT may decide to do one of the following:  
 make a termination and possession order, if ACAT is satisfied that you have breached 
the agreement in a sufficiently serious way to justify terminating it , 
 refuse to make the order, if ACAT considers that you have not breached your agreement  
(or that the breach was not so serious that your tenancy should be ended ), that you have 
fixed the breach , or that you will do so ), or 
 make a ‘performance order ’ which a llows the tenancy to continue but requir es you to 
comply with the terms of your agreement (for example by maintaining the property in 
good condition or by not interfering with the quiet enjoyment of your neighbours) .  74 
 If ACAT makes a termination and possession order, they can suspend this order for up to 
3 weeks .  If you do not move out, your landlord may apply to ACAT for a warrant for your 
eviction , which can ultimately be enforced by the police.  
This process must be followed strictly by the landlord, unless your landlord has previously 
given you two notices to remedy. If that has happened, and you breach the agreement a 
third time, then your landlord can simply issue you with  a notice to vacate.  
If ACAT makes a perfor mance order and you breach that order , then your landlord may 
apply again  to ACAT for a termination and possession order without having to first issue you 
with a new notice to remedy or notice to vacate.  Here again, ACAT will be able to decide 
whether to issue a termination and possession order or to refuse to make the order (if you 
have remedied (or fixed) the breach or if you undertake to do so . If ACAT makes a 
termination and possession order, they can suspend this order for up to 3 weeks.  
NOTE  – if you do not believe the landlord’s claim that you have breached the agreement,  
you can require the landlord to give details and  provide  evidence,  and you can challenge any 
notice when you rece ive it and later through ACAT if it progresses that far.  
 
  75 
 ENDING YOUR TENANCY  
If you want to leave your rental home, or the landlord wants you to leave, it is very important 
that you know your rights and responsibilities and follow the  correct procedures  under the 
Act. Disputes can arise easily if either party does not manage the situation in accordance 
with the law . 
The previous section on ‘Disputes and Breaches of the Agreement’ discusses how a tenancy 
can end because one of the parties has not complied with the residential tenancy 
agreement.  
This secti on discusses the most common ways  a tenancy can end where neither party is at 
fault.  The rules that apply depend on  whether your agreement is for a fixed term or periodic  
and the reason for ending the tenancy .   
In addition to the situations discussed belo w, remember:   
 a tenant and landlord can always end a tenancy  (whether the agreement is fixed term 
or periodic) at any time  and without any compensation if both parties agree  in writing  
to do this  
 under the rules relating to co -tenancies it is possible for just one co -tenant to leave a 
tenancy agreement without the tenancy agreement ending for the other parties.  If you 
would like to leave but your housemates would like to remain , see the section on  share 
housing  for more information.  
See also at the end of this section  where  some  ‘Less Common Scenarios for Ending an 
Agreement ’ are noted.  
WHEN CAN A TENANT END A TENANCY?  
Tenant ending a  fixed term agreement  
Tenant ending a tenancy on or after  the end of a fixed term  
There is a common myth that the end of a fixed term means the end of your tenancy and 
that you must have permission from the landlord to remain in the property or that you must 
“renew” the agreement  with a new fixed term . This is not correct.    
A tenancy agreement is an ongoing agreement usually in two parts – fixed and then periodic.  
When the fixed term ends , your agreement automatically becomes periodic  unless you 
decide to end it as detailed below.   
If you have a fixed term agreement that is coming to the end of the fixed period , and you 
want to move out  rather than signing a new lease  or staying on in a periodic tenancy:   
 You must give the landlord  a ‘notice of intention to vacate’ with  at least  3 weeks’ notice  
before the date you plan to move out  (which cannot be before the end of the agreement) .  
 76 
 The landlord cannot end a tenancy agreement just because the fixed term is ending .  
They also cannot require that you sign a new agreement.   
If you have a fixed term agreement that is coming to the end of the fixed period, and you 
want to stay in the property, you can choose to do nothing and  your tenancy will become a 
periodic  tenancy automatically after the end of the fixed term.  
See below on ‘ Requirements for Notices’  for how to give a notice of intention to vacate . 
See below on ‘ Landlord ending a fixed term agreement early’  for additional circumstances in 
which your landlord maybe able to end your tenancy during a fixed term agreement.  
Tenant ending a fixed term tenancy agreement early  or ‘breaking the lease’  
If you want to end your fixed term agree ment early , you can but you may need to pay 
compensation to your landlord .  There are some limited situations where you can do this 
without having to  pay compensation to the landlord. The more common of these situations 
are summarised in the table below.  
In some  of these  situations, you can end your agreement simply by giving your landlord a 
‘notice of intention to vacate ’ that informs them you will move out on a certain date. See 
below on ‘ Requirements for Notices ’ for how to give a  notice of intention to vacate. You must 
make sure you give your landlord the minimum required notice period.  
In other situations, an ACAT order is required to end your agreement. You need to apply for 
the order, rather than issuing a notice to your landlord. ACAT will hear from you and from the 
landlord and decide whether  to make an order ending  your tenancy.  
Remember that the co -tenancy rules also allow a single co -tenant to leave a fixed term 
agreement without bringing the tenancy to  an end for the remaining parties.  This requires 
consent from both the landlord and remaining co -tenant(s). See the section on share 
housing  for more information.  
You may wish to dis cuss your situation with your landlord and seek legal advice  before going 
to ACAT.

A court has made a protection order (interim

ACAT has flexible powers to deal with the 
situation appropriately. For example, ACAT 
may either end the lease so you can move 
out, or end the lease and require the landlord 
to enter into a new lease with you, so that 
you can stay in the property and others may

If none of the above situations apply – you may still wish to break your lease early and pay 
compensation to the landlord.  
Paying compensation for  break ing your lease  early   
If you end your fixed term agreement early, other than for a reason permitted under the Act 
(as listed above), you will generally need to compensate your landlord. If you have a  ‘break 
lease clause ’ in your residential tenancy agreement , this caps the amount  you have to pay  
(the ‘break  lease  fee’).   
There are two steps for calculating the break lease fee. First, work out  whether you are more 
than half -way through your fixed term (e.g. whether 6  months has pa ssed on a 12 month 
lease).  
 If you are less than half -way through your fixed term, your break lease fee is a 
maximum of 6 weeks’ rent . 78 
  If you are more than half -way through your fixed term , your break lease fee is a 
maximum of 4 weeks’ rent . 
Second, your break lease fee will be lower if your landlord finds a new tenant to move in 
within a defined period after you vacate the property.  
 If you are less than half -way through your fixed term, the defined period is 6 weeks.  
 If you are more than half-way through your fixed term, the defined period is 4 weeks.  
If your landlord has a  new tenant  move in  during the defined period, then the break lease fee 
you have to pay is:  
 reduced by the rent payable by the new tenant during the defined period  (at the rate 
paid by th e new  tenant,  even if higher  than your rent ), but  
 includes  the landlord’s reasonable administrative costs of re -letting the property  (e.g. 
advertising)  up to a capped limit  (unless  you vacate the property less than 4 weeks 
before  the fixed term  ends , in which case the landlord cannot claim administrative costs ). 
The capped limit for the landlord’s administrative costs is:  
 one week’s rent, if you are less than half -way through your fixed term, or  
 two-thirds of one week’s rent, if y ou are more than half -way through your fixed term . 
Your landlord can only claim the amount of administrative costs actually spent (if they spend 
less than the capped amount, they cannot claim it regardless).   
The landlord also cannot claim administrative c osts if this would make the break lease fee 
exceed the maximum amount  of 4 weeks’ or 6 weeks’ rent . 
An example  follows : 
 Mark is a tenant who wants to break his fixed term agreement early. His agreement is for 
12 months and it has a break lease clause. His rent is $600 per week . He has 4 months 
remaining on his agreement (so he is more than half -way through his fixed term).  
 Mark’s break fee will be a maximum of 4 weeks’ rent, so $2400.  
 Mark’s landlord, Kate, finds a new tenant , Heather,  who moves in 3 weeks after Mark 
moves out. This is within the defined period (of 4 weeks) under the break lease clause 
rules.  
 Kate increases the rent for Heather  to $610 per week.  Heather will pay $610 in rent for 
the one week that remains of the defined period.  
 Kate spends $550 on advertising and other fees associated with reletting the property.  
 The break fee payable by Mark will be $2400 – $610 + $550 = $2340.  
A fact sheet with more examples of how the break lease clause works is available on the 
Justic e and Community Safety Directorate website at:  https://www.justice.act.gov.au/renting -
and-occupancy -laws/reforms -to-tenancy -and-occupancy -laws-in-2023/reforms -in-2019 .  79 
 The break lease clause  rules are designed to be fair to both landlords and tenants. The y 
ensure that landlords cannot claim compensation for lost  rent while  a new tenant is paying 
rent, while  compensat ing the landlord for costs incurred in having to re -let the property early.  
To activate your break lease fee clause, you must notify your landlord of your intention to 
vacate on a particular date. You must pay rent up to that date as well as the break fee. See 
below on ‘ Requirements for Notices’  for how to give a notice of intention to vacate.  
Note  that these break lease rules apply to residential tenancy agreements of 3 years or less. 
If your agreement is for more than 3 years, check the Act and  your agreement and  seek 
legal advice  as necessary.  
I don’t have a break lease clause in my agreement  
If you do not have a break lease clause  in your agreement, and you wish to end your fixed 
term agreement early,  you can still do this by notifying your landlo rd. Your landlord may 
apply to ACAT for compensation.  However, in this situation, your landlord is still only able 
to claim compensation for the actual loss es they incur and they must actively try to 
reduce th ose losses   – this is called ‘mitigating loss ’. 
Mitigating Loss  
In any situation where either the landlord or tenant might be able to claim compensation for 
loss from the other , the person who intends to claim compensation must take active steps to 
try to reduce their loss  (this is called the  duty to mitigate ). If they do not do this , then they 
will not be entitled to all or part of the compensation that they are seeking.  
Any comp ensation claimed is also limited to the actual amount lost . This means that if you 
break your lease (regar dless of whether you have a break lease clause), as soon as new 
tenants are found (who will pay the same amount, or a higher amount of rent than what you 
were paying) the n your landlord will no longer be suffering any loss and so will be unable to 
claim co mpensation from you.  
The duty to mitigate  means that your landlord must try to find replacement tenants as soon 
as possible to try to reduce the amount that you will owe them in compensation.   
If your landlord  does not try to find replacement tenants (for  example , if they do not advertise 
the property  or if they unreasonably refuse replacement tenants ) then they may not be able 
to claim the full amount of compensation that might otherwise have been owed to them .  
Tenant ending a  periodic  tenancy agreement  
You can end a periodic residential tenancy agreement by giving 3 weeks’ notice  of your 
intention  to vacate to  the landlord . You do not need to pay the landlord any compensation to 
do this. You also do not need to provide any reason for  wanting to  end the agreement.  See 
below on ‘ Requirements for Notices’  for how to give a notice of intention to vacate.  
You do not need an order from ACAT to end your agreement  – you just need to move out by 
the date you said you would on your notice to the landlord (and follow the end of tenancy 
inspection processes) . 
Remember that the co -tenancy rules also allow a single co -tenant to leave a periodic  
tenancy without bringing the tenancy to an end for the remaining parties.  This requires 80 
 consent from both the landlord and remaining co -tenant(s). See the section on share 
housing  for more information.  
 
WHEN CAN A LANDLORD END A TENANCY?  
Landlord  ending a  fixed term agreement early  
A landlord can  usually end a fixed term residential tenancy agreement early  if: 
 You have breached the terms of your tenancy agreement  and you move out in 
accordance with a notice to vacate issued by your landlord or where ACAT makes a 
termination and possession order to end the tenancy (see  the section on breaches).  
 The landlord is experiencing significant hardship  and ACAT makes an order 
allowing them to end the agreement . Examples of hardship might include if the 
landlord is facing bankruptcy or homelessness. ACAT will only make the order if the 
landlord’s hardship is greater than the hardship that the tenant would su ffer from the 
early termination of the tenancy. ACAT will determine the notice period required to the 
tenant.  
 The landlord has been posted back to Canberra for their work . This option  only 
applies if you have the ‘ posting termination clause  in your agreement . The landlord must 
give the tenant  8 weeks’ notice and evidence of the posting (e.g. a letter from their 
employer).  
See further below on ‘ Less common scenarios for ending an agreement’ . 
Landlord ending a periodic agreement  
Aside from circumstances where the tenant  has breached the agreement (see the section on 
breach ), a landlord can end a periodi c residential tenancy agreement  in the situations 
listed in the following table.  
Landlord’s reason for ending the tenancy  Notice 
period 
required  
The landlord  genuinely intends to  live in the property.  
 
A relative or someone with a close relationship  with the landlord 
genuinely intends to live in the property.  See clause 96 of the Standard 
Terms for how this category of people is defined.  
 8 weeks  
 
 
The landlord genuinely intends to sell the property . 8 weeks  
 
The landlord genuinely intends to rebuild, renovate or make major 
repairs  to the property , which cannot reasonably be carried out with the 
tenant living there . 
 12 weeks  
 
The landlord genuinely requires  the premises  for a lawful use other 26 weeks  81 
 than as a home  (e.g. they want to use it as a place of business) .  
 
Landlords cannot end a tenancy for no reason: they must give you a reason 
recognised under the law. For example, landlords cannot end a tenancy because they 
want to increase the rent and you do not agree.  
For each of the above reasons  the landlord must also provide you with some evidence about 
their genuine reliance on the ground for ending a tenancy that they have listed in the notice.  
For example, if your lanldord indicates that they wa nt to end the tenancy because they want 
to renovate the property they will need to provide you with evidence that they intend to 
renovate.  
The type of evidence provided may depend on the reason the lanldord wants to end the 
tenancy.  Examples of evidence could include:  
 A statutory  declaration  
 Quotes or architectural drawings for renovations  
 Development application  
 A sales contract for a property  
If you receive a notice to vacate from your landlord, you can decide to leave the property 
earlier than the date set by the landlord, by giving your landlord notice of your intention to 
vacate:  
 with 4 days’ notice , if you leave at any time during the last two weeks of the landlord’s 
notice period, or  
 with 3 weeks’ notice at any other time.  
If you consider that y our landlord is requir ing you to vacate your property under one of these 
grounds for reasons that are not genuine, you may apply to ACAT  to dispute the notice (or  
for compensation  if you have moved out in accordance with the notice) . You may wish to 
seek legal advice  in relation to this option . 
If you do not move out in accordance with the notice to vacate issued to you by your 
landlord , then they can apply to ACAT for a termination and possession order which is an 
order to end the tenancy.  
 
REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTICES  
Where a tenant issues a notice of intention to vacate to the landlord, or a landlord issues a 
notice to vacate to the tenan t, there is no set form to use but the following basic 
requirements must be met.   
The notice  must be in writing  . The content  of the notice  must  include : 
 the address of the property  82 
  adequate detail s of the reason/s for issuing the notice (which must be one of the grounds 
for ending  a tenancy that are permitted under the Act)  
 for a notice issued by a tenant: the date on which the tenant  intend s to vacate the 
premises  (the date must meet any minimum notic e period requirements) , or  
 for a notice issued by a landlord: the date on which the tenant must vacate the property 
(the date must meet any minimum notice period requirements),  and  
 a statement that the tenancy will end on that date.  
Notices of intention to vacate and notices to vacate are also called ‘termination notices ’. 
The Tenancy Advice Service ACT makes sample notices available for use on its website 
(https://www.legalaidact.org.au/tasact ).  
Make sure you use your best efforts so that you will be able to prove that the landlord or 
agent received your notice. Check your residential tenancy agreement w hich will have an 
address for you to serve notices on your landlor d or agent. You need to u se that address, 
however, this does not prevent you from sending the notice in multiple ways (eg by post and 
email)  if you want to. . 
Note:  there are particular ‘service requirements ’ for when a landlord issues a notice to 
vacate to a tenant.  
Special service rules for notices to vacate issued by landlords to tenants s 
As notices to vacate are such important notices (they can lead to a tenancy ending), there 
are special rules which requi re the landlord to give the  notice to  tenant in a particular way.  
These are called ‘service’ requirements.  ‘Service’ is a legal term for the particular way a 
legal notice (such as a notice to vacate) is given to a person.   
The rules require that notices to vacate must be served on the tenant by:  
• delivering it to the tenant personally (e.g, handing it to them); or  
• leaving it at , or posting it to , the place of residence or business of the tenant.  
 
This means notices to vacate cannot be sent by ema il or text message  (unless they are 
also served correctly in person or by post). It is possible to send other types of notices (such 
as notices of an inspection or repair ) via email if the tenant has provided an email address 
as the address for service for  a notice.   
The timeframes for the required notice to vacate period begin from when the notice is 
served. A notice served by post is taken to have been served when the document would 
have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.  
When something is d elivered in the ordinary course of post may vary.  The Australia Post 
website  provides some guidance on delivery speeds. At the time of writing , Australia post 
indicated that regular letters sent within the same State will generally be received 2 -4 
business days after  the day they are posted .  
 83 
 EXAMPLE  1 
A landlord decides that they want to sell the rental property , which requires the landlord to 
give the tenant 8 weeks’ notice to vacate. On 1 June 2023 the landlord posts a notice to 
vacate to the tenant. They allow 4 working  days after the day it was posted for the notice to 
arrive. This means the notice period should not begin until 7 June 2023. This means the 
vacate date on the notice cannot be before 2 August 2023. If a notice to vacate on the 
grounds of sale sent by post on 1 June 2023 had a vacate date before 2 August 2023 (8 
weeks after 7 June) it may be considered an invalid notice.  
EXAMPLE 2  
If the landlord in EXAMPLE 1 instead decided to hand del iver the notice to vacate on 1  June 
2023 it would be considered to have been served on the day of delivery (1 June 2023).  This 
means this notice could list a vacate date of 27 July 2023 (8 weeks after 1 June  2023 ).  
Note  – it is possible to issue a notice  in multiple different ways just to ensure it has been 
received.  For example, your landlord may send you the notice by post, hand deliver it and 
send it via email. So long as one of the ways the notice is sent to you meets the service and 
notice period re quirements, the notice will likely be considered valid.  
If you are not sure if a notice to vacate you have received has been served correctly, you 
may wish to seek legal advice .  
 
LESS COMMON SCENARIOS FOR ENDING AN 
AGREEMENT  
There are a range of other  less common  situations where a  residential tenancy agreement 
(whether fixed term or periodic)  can be ended  either by the tenant or the landlord . These 
include:  
 The property is not fit for habitation (e.g. an internal wall has collapsed or the roof has 
blown off) .  
 The tenant lived in the property as part of an employment agreement that has ended and 
the landlord needs to use the property for anothe r employee.  
 The property is used as crisis accommodation by a registered crisis accommodation 
provider and the provider needs to use it for someone other than the current tenant . 
 The landlord or the tenant entered into the agreement because of a false or misleading 
statement made by the other party.  
 The landlord  or the tenant  has caused (or recklessly permitted) serious danger to the 
property , the property of the other party, or injury to the other party or a member of their 
family.  
 The landlord or tenant has threatened, harrassed, intimidated or abused the other party.  84 
  The tenant abandons the property  (moves out and stops paying rent  without giving a 
notice of intention to vacate to their lanldord ). Note: If this occurs, t he landlord may apply 
to ACAT for compensation.  
 A person other than the landlord becomes legally entitled to possess the property (e.g. 
the person inherits the prope rty following the landlord’s death or the bank forecloses on 
the property following a mortgage default by the landlord).  Note: this provision does not 
generally apply if the property is sold to someone else.  
 The property has been identified by the Governm ent as being affected by loose -fill 
asbestos (it is listed on the relevant Government register and/or it is eligible for the 
Government’s buyback program).  See further the information on Loose -Fill Asbestos  
section . 
 The property is unavailable due to some action by the Government (e.g. part of a suburb 
has been evacuated  in emergency circumstances  or the Government has undertaken a 
compulsory acquisition of the property from the landlord ).  
 The tenant or landlord  is unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the 
tenancy agreement (this is known as repudiation ).  
If any of these situatio ns may apply to you, check the Act for the specific rules that apply to 
ending tenancies on these grounds, and seek legal advice  as necessary. In some cases an 
ACAT order will be necessary to terminate the tenancy.    
WHEN DOES THE TENANCY AGREEMENT 
ACTUALLY END?  
A tenancy agreement does not automatically end because:  
 the tenant has given notice of i ntention to vacate  
 the landlord has issued a notice to vacate  
 the parties have agreed to an end date for the agreement , or 
 the fixed  term of a tenancy agreement has ended .  
Where either the landlord or tenant has issued a notice to end the tenancy , or where the 
landlord and tenant have mutually agreed a tenancy end date, the tenancy will only end 
on the vacate date listed in the notice (or the agreed tenancy end date ) if the tenant 
actually moves out  (and returns the keys) on or before the agreed en d date .  
In the case of a fixed term agreement reaching the end of the fixed period, the tenancy will 
simply continue on as a periodic tenancy , unless the tenant issues a notice to their landlord 
indicating they want to end the agreement on or after the en d of the fixed term (or they 
voluntarily agree to enter a new  fixed term  agreement).  
What happens if the tenant does not move out?  
If the tenant does not move out in accordance with the notice to vacate  in accordance with a 
notice to vacate , the landlord cannot just change the locks or remove the tenants 85 
 belongings from the property .  Instead, they will need to apply to the ACT Civil and 
Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) for an order to end the tenancy.   
If ACAT makes an order to end the tenancy and the tenant still does not move out, the 
landlord can then apply to ACAT for a warrant for eviction. If ACAT issues a warrant it will be 
served on the tenant by the police.  If the tenant does not move out after receiving the 
warrant, the police can execute the warrant and remove the tenant and their belongings from 
the property.  
 
WHAT CAN I DO IF I THINK MY LANDLORD IS JUST 
ENDING MY TENANCY BECAUSE I ASSERTED MY 
RIGHTS IN SOME WAY (RETALIATORY EVICTIONS)?  
Landl ords are not permitted to end a tenancy because their tenant has asserted their legal 
rights in relation to the tenancy in particular ways. If a landlord does this , it is known as a 
‘retaliatory eviction. ’ 
 For an eviction to be considered retaliatory, one of the following things must have occurred:  
 You have applied to ACAT for an order in relation to your landlord (e.g., an order that 
your landlord undertake repairs or an order to challenge a rent increase)  
 ACAT made an order in your favour against the landlord (e.g., the landlord ordered your 
landlord to stop attending your property without giving you notice)  
 You have complained to a Government entity in relation to your landlord  
 You took reasonable action to secure or enforce your ri ghts (e.g., you sought legal 
advice or invited your landlord to participate in mediation)  
 You have spoken to the media or published information yourself (e.g., by posting on 
social media) about your landlord, your tenancy agreement or the rental property ( and 
the information was not false or misleading)  
If, following one (or more) of the above situations, your landlord issued you with a notice to 
vacate , this may be a retaliatory eviction . If you are concerned that your landlord’s reasons 
for issuing the no tice to vacate are not genuine , and that they were instead motivated to end 
the tenancy because you asserted your rights , you can challenge this by application to 
ACAT.  
Challenging a notice to vacate on the ba sis it is retaliatory  
If you want to challenge  a notice on the basis it is retaliatory , you can apply to ACAT for an 
order disallowing the notice. To do this, you must make an application to ACAT before the 
vacate date stated in the notice to vacate  you received from your landlord. To make an 
order disallowing a notice to vacate, ACAT must be satisfied that one of the circumstances 
listed above has occurred , and that your landlord was motivated to issue the notice to vacate 
because you asserted your rights in one of those  circumstances.  86 
 You will need to have evidence of your actions to give to ACAT. Your landlord may provide 
ACAT with evidence to demonstrate why their reliance on the ground for ending the tenancy 
listed in the notice was genuine. ACA T will then determine whether it is appropriate to make 
the order disallowing the notice.  
If ACAT disallow s the notice to vacate, your tenancy agreement will continue.  If ACAT 
disagrees with you and decides the notice to vacate is genuine, you will have the remainder 
of the notice period to find alternate accommodation.  
If you are considering challenging a notice to vacate on the basis it is retaliatory, you may 
wish to seek legal advice  before making your application.  
Landlord may apply to ACAT if you do not move out  
If you think your eviction is retaliatory but you do not challenge the notice to vacate you 
received , and you do  not move out of the property , your landlord may apply to ACAT for an 
order to end your tenancy (this is known as a Termination and Possession Order or a TPO). 
If your landlord has made this application, you will receive a copy of their application and 
have a chance to attend the hearing. At the hearing, you can tell the Tribunal if you think the 
eviction is retaliatory. ACAT can then refuse to make an order to end the tenancy if they are 
satisfied that you r landlord was attempting a retaliatory eviction.  Be aware that if ACAT 
disagrees with you and decides to make an order ending the tenancy , you may only have a 
very short period of time in which to leave the property  (at most, ACAT can suspend the 
order for 3 weeks).  
If you are in this situation, you may wish to seek legal advice  before attending the ACAT 
hearing.  
  87 
 ADDITIONAL  GROUNDS FOR ENDING A  
TENANCY : COMMUNITY HOUSING, 
SUBSIDISED ACCOMMODATION AND CRISIS 
ACCOMMODATION  
Community Housing Provider s (CHPs ) are community organisation s that provide 
accommodation programs for eligible community members .  There is a national law that 
allows community housing organisations to be registered. Once registered, these 
organisations are referred to as ‘registered community housing providers.’  
These accommodation programs are often targetted at vulnerable or at -risk members of the 
community  and may includes crisis accommodation or community -based social or affordable 
housing programs. In some circumstances, either the ACT or Commonwealth Government 
provides funding support to CHPs (or other accommodation providers)  to make these 
accommodation programs available.  The ACT Government will also sometimes make ACT 
Government -owned properties available to CHPs to manage as part of a community housing 
program.  
There are certain circumstances where the CHP (or other Gover nment funded 
accommodation provider) may need to end a tenancy, including where the tenant is no 
longer eligible for the assistance  being provided to them or from the CHP. To help support 
the effective operation of these community -based accommodation where  the property 
owner requires the property back  programs and to ensure they are targeted at those most 
in need , tenancy laws allow a tenancy to be ended on the following grounds:  
 Where your landlord is a Community Housing Provider (CHP) but the property is 
owned by someone else and the property owner needs the CHP to return the 
property to them.  
 
 Where you do  not provide the information needed to assess your ongoing eligibility 
for subsidised accommodation  (or your accommodation provider’s eligibility to 
receive Government funding or assistance  where your provider’s eligibility is based 
on you meeting certain criteria ).  
 
 You have  stopped (or will stop) being eligible for subsidised accommodation, or your 
landlord has stopped (or will stop) being eligible for Government funding or 
assistance to provide the accommodation to you. 
 
 Your landlord is a declared cris is accommodation provider and they need the 
accommodation for another person in need of emergency accommodation.  
Each of these grounds is explained below.  
 88 
 WHEN THE PROPERTY OWNER REQUIRES THE 
PROPERTY BACK  FROM THE CHP  
In some circumstances the ACT Government or private property owners make their 
properties available to a CHP so that the CHP can use the property as part of a community 
social or affordable housing program  or for crisis accommodation . Sometimes, the ACT 
Government or the private proper ty owner may need to ask the CHP to return the property to 
them.  
To this end,  there is a ground for ending a tenancy which allows a CHP to issue a notice to 
vacate to you where the property owner advises the CHP that they need the property back 
for a rea son identified in the provision. This provision  will automatically be included in any 
tenancy agreement with a CHP where the rental property is owned by someone else . The 
amount of notice the CHP will need to give to you will depend on the reason the property 
owner needs the property back.  
The reasons an owner can give for needing the property back and the amount of notice that 
must be given to you are: 
• the owner genuinely intends to sell the property (8 weeks’ notice)  
• the owner (or a family member or someone close to the landlord) genuinely intends 
to live in the property (8 weeks’ notice)  
• the owner genuinely intends to rebuild, renovate or make major repairs to the 
property that cannot be done while the tenant is living  at the property (12 weeks’ 
notice); and  
• (if the owner is not Housing ACT) the owner genuinely intends to stop using the 
property for community housing (26 weeks’ notice).  
These reasons to end a tenancy can only be used where the tenancy agreement is a 
periodic agreement.  
A CHP is also able to end a tenancy (regardless of whether it is a fixed term or periodic 
tenancy) where Housing ACT has provided the property to the CHP under a housing 
assistance program and Housing ACT has withdrawn assistance from th e CHP in 
accordance with the housing assistance program.  
Evidence requirements  
For each of these grounds to end a tenancy, the CHP must provide you with written 
evidence to support the owner’s genuine reason for requiring the CHP to end the tenancy .  
This evidence must be given to you at the same time as  the CHP gives you the notice to 
vacate . Examples of evidence could include a statutory declaration, a development 
application, quotes from a tradesperson in relation to renovations , or, a notice of decisi on 
from Housing ACT.  
If you are a tenant in a community housing property and have received a notice to vacate 
because the owner wants the property back you may wish to seek legal advice  about your 
rights.   89 
 SUBSIDISED ACCOMMODATION TENANCIES  
What is ‘subsidised accommodation’?  
‘Subsidised accommodation’ is a term used to describe certain types of accommodation 
offered to eligible community members by non -Government accommodation provide rs. This  
term includes:  
• tenancies offered by CHPs (including where the CHP is the landlord or where the 
CHP is managing the property for the owner); and  
• tenancies where the owner of the property or the landlord receives Government 
funding or assistance to provide the premises to you.  
This term captures tenancies offered under the National Rental Affordability Scheme, 
tenancies offered under the ACT Govern ment’s Community Affordable Housing program and 
other social and affordable housing tenancies offered by CHPs where you pay less than the 
‘market rate’ in rent. It may also capture accommodation programs offered by CHPs on their 
own initiative.  
The key fe ature of subsidised acommodation programs are that they are provided to you 
based on eligibility criteria . To ensure these programs are able to continue operating as 
intended, there are grounds for ending a tenancy where your are  no longer eligible for the  
accommodation or where you do not provide your landlord with information that is 
reasonably necessary to assess your ongoing eligibility.  
Information that must be provided to you at the start of the tenancy  
To ensure you are aware of any criteria that you must meet during your tenancy, the Act 
requires that subsidised accommodation providers  to tell you  about the eligibility 
requirements at the start of the tenancy .  This includes any rules or requirements against 
which:  
• your eligibility to live in the property could be assessed during the tenancy, or  
• your landlord’s or property owner’s eligibility to receive government funding or 
assistance in relation to the property could be assessed during the tenancy.  
The Act refers  to these as ‘subsidised accommodation eligibility requirements.’   
Information that must be provided to  you during the tenancy: changes to 
eligibility criteria  
If the subsidised accommodation eligibility requirements change during the tenancy, the 
accommo dation provider must give you a copy of the changed requirements within 2  weeks:  
• if the accommodation provider changes the requirements of their own volition - they 
must advise you of the change within 2 weeks of the change occurring; or  
• if the Government funder changes the eligibility requirements - the accommodation 
provider must advise you within 2 weeks of when the accommodation provider is 
advised of the changed requirements.  
For example, if the subsidised accommodation is provided t o the tenant on the basis that 
your income falls within a certain income threshold, the applicable income threshold may be 
indexed each year. If the Government advises the subsidised accommodation provider of a 90 
 new income threshold, the provider must tell you of the changed income limit within 2 weeks 
of when they were advised by the Government.  
You must provide information relating to eligibility requirements  
To ensure subsidised accommodation can operate effectively, providers need to be able to 
request information from the ir tenant s to assess their ongoing eligibility for the 
accommodation.   
To allow them to do this, the law allows the accommodation provider to write to you to 
request any information that is reasonably necessary to assess eligibility (e ither your 
eligibility to live in the property or the provider or owner’s eligibility for government funding or 
assistance). This means the accommodation provider can only request information that is 
relevant or necessary to assess eligibility (and not oth er, unrelated information).  
Where the accommodation provider makes this request, they must give you a reasonable 
period in which to provide the information.  
It is now a requirement  in the standard terms for subsidised accommodation tenancies that 
you agree to give your accommodation provider the requested information as part of the 
tenancy agreement. However, the standard term also indicates  that a failure to provide the 
information on request is not considered to be a breach of the agreement.  This is be cause it 
is much faster to terminate a tenancy on the basis of a breach of the agreement than by 
following the process set out in the new termination ground of failure to provide information 
set out below.  Clarifying that a failure to provide information is not a breach of the 
agreement ensures that accommodation providers  must use the new termination ground so 
that you  have the benefit of the additional procedural protections set out below.  
ENDING S UBSIDISED ACCOMMODATION  – WHERE 
YOU DO NOT  PROVIDE INFOR MATION NEEDED TO 
ASSESS ELIGIBILITY  
Ground to end the tenancy and notice period  
Subsidised accommodation providers can end a tenancy where they have requested 
information from you to assess your ongoing eligibility for to accommodation, but you have 
not provided the required information within the timeframe  stated in the request (noti ng there 
is a requirement that you be given a  reasonable  amount of time to provide the information) . 
In such circumstances, your accommodaiton provider can give the you a 26-week notice to 
vacate the property.  91 
 Requirements for the notice to vacate  
The noti ce to vacate must include the following information:  
• a statement that you did not give the landlord the requested information  
• the name and contact details of a legal or advocacy service that may be able to 
provide you with advice about your legal rights, a nd 
• a statement that the notice will be withdrawn if you give the requested information to 
the landlord before the end of the notice period.  
This is so that you are  aware of why your tenancy could be ended and so you have  
information about what  you can do to prevent the tenancy ending.  
Withdrawal of notice if tenant provides the requested information  
If you provide  all of the information requested to assess your eligibility before the end of the 
26-week notice period, th en the notice to vacate will automatically be withdrawn and the 
tenancy will continue. If you only provide some of the requested information, the notice to 
vacate will remain valid (until you provide all the required information).  
Notice period if you are  later found to be ineligible  
Subsidised accommodation providers can also end a tenancy where you no longer meet the 
eligibility criteria  (see further below) .  This normally requires a 26 -week notice to vacate. 
However, in circumstances where:  
• the landlor d has already provided you with a notice to vacate on the basis that you 
have  not provided the information required to assess your ongoing eligibility  
• the notice has been automatically withdrawn because you provided the requested 
information, and  
• your landlord determines on the basis of the information provided by you that you 
have  stopped or will stop being eligible for the accommodation,  
then the landlord can give you a new notice to vacate with a vacate date that is the later of:  
• the date stated in  the original notice to vacate on the ground you did not provide the 
requested information; or  
• 12 weeks after the new notice to vacate is given on the ground you are  ineligible.  
Example  
On 1 July, Poppy’s landlord gives Poppy a notice to vacate because Poppy did not 
provide the landlord with information about Poppy’s eligibility for subsidised housing 
within the required period. The notice to vacate gives Poppy the required  26 weeks’ 
notice, meaning  Poppy  must vacate the premises by 30 December.  
On 1  August, Poppy gives the landlord all the information the landlord requested and 
the first notice to vacate is taken to be withdrawn. Taking into account the new 
information, the landlord dete rmines that Poppy is no longer eligible to live in the 
premises.  
The landlord may give Poppy a second notice to vacate, but the second notice must 
not have a notice period that ends before  30 December.  
 92 
 Where a notice to vacate is given on the ground the you are  no longer eligible, the notice 
must include certain information (see further below).  
ENDING S UBSIDISED ACCOMMODATION  – WHERE 
THE TENANT IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE  
Ground to end the tenancy and notice period  
A subsidised accommodation provider can end a tenancy where:  
• You have  stopped or will stop being eligible to live in the property; or  
• Your has  landlord stop ped or will stop being eligible to receive funding or assistance 
to provide the pr operty  to you.  
The length or notice required may depend o n the circumstances. Your landlord is required to 
give you notice with a vacate date which is the later of the following dates:  
• 26 weeks from the date the notice is given to you; or 
• if the notice is given on the basis that you have  stopped or will stop bei ng eligible to 
live in the premises —the day you stop being eligible to live in the premises; or  
• if your landlord  gives the notice because the y have stopped, or will stop, being eligible 
to receive government funding or assistance to provide the pr operty  to you —the day 
your landlord stops being eligible for funding or assistance for the premises.  
This variable notice period is designed to accommodate the operation of the National Rental 
Affordability Scheme (NRAS).  The  current  National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 
2020  (NRAS regulations) provides that  a tenant will cease to be an eligible tenant if the 
combined gross household income exceeds the income limit for their household by 25% or 
more in two consecutive eligibility years.  
In the case of an NRAS accommodation pr ovider, the provider may anticipate that you will 
become ineligible where your income has already exceeded the income limit by 25 % for one 
year. In this situation, the accommodation provider could anticipate that you  may ineligible if 
you exceed the incom e limit by 25 % for a second year.   
The provider could then issue you a notice to vacate on the basis that you have  exceeded 
the income limit by 25% or more and will stop being eligible for subsidised accommodation 
at the end of the 2 year period. You would then be required to vacate the property either at 
the end of the two -year period in which you have  exceeded the income limit by 25% or more 
OR 26 weeks after you receive the notice to vacate – whichever is the later.  
Requirements for the notice to vacate  
If your landlord gives you a notice to vacate on the basis of eligibility, the notice must include 
the following information:  
• if you have  stopped, or will stop, being eligible to live in the pr operty —the reason why; 
or 93 
 • if your landlord  has stopped, or wil l stop, being eligible to receive government funding 
or assistance to provide the proprety to you —the reason why; and  
• the name and contact details of a legal or advocacy service that may be able to 
provide you with advice about your legal rights.  
This is so you are  aware of why your tenancy could be ended, and so you have  information 
about where you can go for advice in relation to your tenancy.   
If you disagree with the landlord’s assessment of your eligibility, then you could bring a 
tenancy dis pute application to ACAT in relation to the notice  to vacate .    
ADDITIONAL ISSUES  
This section discusses additional issues that should be considered when the CHP and 
subsidised accommodation grounds  for ending a tenancy are used .  
Note:  this discussion do es not apply to the crisis accommodation termination ground.  
You can end the tenancy earlier than the date in the notice to vacate  
Where you have  been given a notice to vacate by your landlord on the CHP or subsidised 
accommodation termination grounds, you are  able to end the tenancy earlier than the date 
stated in the landlord’s notice to vacate.  You can do this by giving  your landlord a notice of 
intention to vacate that gives:  
• at least 2 weeks’ notice; or  
• if there is less than 2 weeks left in the landlord’s notice to vacate to you, you can give 
4 days’ notice.  
This may assist you to avoid having to pay rent on two properties at once where you are 
able to find alternate accommodation before your original ten ancy ends.  
What is the reasonable and proportionate test for tenancy termination?  
If you do not move out in accordance with the notice to vacate, your landlord will need to 
apply to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) for an order to end the tenancy.   
Where your landlord applies to end a tenancy on the CHP or subsidised accommodation 
termination grounds, ACAT must consider if ending the tenancy is reasonable and 
proportionate in the circumstances. This is an additional safeguard for you.  
When deciding if it is reasonable and proportionate to end a community housing or 
subsidised accommodation tenancy, ACAT must take into account:  
• the history and length of the tenancy  
• the functions of the landlord in providing subsidised housing, including  any funding 
requirements or contractual obligations on the landlord in relation to the provision of 
subsidised accommodation  
• the landlord’s  interest in the efficient  management of  subsidised housing (including 
other premises) provided by the landlord  
• the publ ic interest in the efficient management and availability of subsidised housing  
• the financial impact on the  landlord  or owner  if the residential tenancy agreement is 
not terminated  
• the conduct of the  tenant and the landlord or owner  in relation to matters t hat are 
relevant to the notice for termination being served on the tenant  94 
 • any hardship that the tenant will, or is likely to, suffer if the residential tenancy 
agreement is terminated, including — 
o financial hardship  
o difficulties in finding suitable alternative premises  
o any risk of the tenant experiencing a prolonged period of homelessness, and  
o impacts on the tenant’s physical or mental health, and  
• any other matter the ACAT considers relevant.  
 
This range of factors is designed to give ACAT guidance on issues to consider when 
determining if it is reasonable and proportionate to end the tenancy.  
Note:   The reasonable and proportionate test only applies where a CHP or subsidised 
accommodation prov ider seeks to terminate a tenancy on the CHP or subsidised 
accommodation termination grounds. It does not apply to other grounds to end a tenancy 
that can be exercised by CHPs or subsidised accommodation providers (such as breach of 
the agreement).  
 
ENDIN G CRISIS ACCOMMODATION  – WHERE 
PROPERTY IS NEEDED FOR ANOTHER PERSON  
What is a ‘declared crisis accommodation provider’?  
The Attorney -General may declare an organisation as a ‘crisis accommodation provider’, 
where the organisation:  
• provides emergency acco mmodation for people in crisis, and  
• provides information to people staying in the accommodation about alternative 
accommodation and other services that the person could access.  
Information that must be provided to tenants at the start of the tenancy  
Before  a crisis accommodation provider can use this ground for ending a tenancy, they must, 
at the start of the tenancy, tell you in writing that they can end the tenancy on 4 weeks’ notice 
if they need the property to provide crisis accommodation to someone els e. This ensures 
you are  aware , from the very start of the tenancy , that it could be ended at short notice.  
Ending a crisis accommodation tenancy  
Where an organisation (such as a CHP) has been declared as a ‘crisis accommodation 
provider’ they can use the crisis accommodation ground to end a tenancy. To use this 
ground, the crisis accommodation provider must:  
• need the property to provide crisis accommodation to someone else  
• give you information about alternative accommodation, and  
• give you 4 weeks’ notice t o vacate the property.  
  95 
 END OF TENANCY PROCEDURES  
This section discusses the things you need to take care of when moving out of your rental 
property.  See also the ‘ End of Tenancy Checklist ’ at the beginning of the Renting Book.    
Before reading this section, you should also consider if your tenancy is being ended lawfully . 
For example, consider whether  you or your landlord have provided the correct notice to end 
the tena ncy, if needed – refer to the section on Ending your tenancy  for more information or 
seek legal advice ).  
FINAL INSPECTION  AND CONDITION REPORT  
You and the landlord  must carry out a  final inspection of the p roperty  at the end of the 
residential tenancy agreement.  The purpose of the final inspection is to check that the 
property is in the same substantially the same state  of cleanliness and repair  as at the 
beginning of the tenancy (fair wear and tear excepted). This inspection must be done 
jointly,  unless you or the landlord agree not to b e there  (or you fail to attend) . 
You are not required to use professional cleaning services at the end of a tenancy. The only 
exception is that you may be required to get the carpets professionally cleaned, if this 
requirement is stated in your residential  tenancy agreement and your landlord has provided 
evidence that this was done at the start of your tenancy.  
You and the landlord must complete and sign a condition report  based on the inspection.  
A template condition report is available from the ACT Revenu e Office website : 
https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_fi le/0020/1093043/Condition -Report.pdf . 
The report may be signed by only one party only if the other party has been provided with a 
reasonable opportunity to be present and has chosen not to be  present.  
The condition report will be evidence of the state of th e property so it is important you 
check it and note if you  agree with it.   
If you do not agree with aspects of the report  – for example if you do not agree there is 
damage or if you think that something the  landlord  claim s is damage is actually fair wear and 
tear  (see below for defin ition of fair wear and tear)  – you should note this on the report when 
you sign it. You may wish to take photos of any damage to the property that is raised as an 
issue at the final inspection.  Make sure you keep a copy of the final condition report.  
 
If your landlord suggests that you are responsible for any damage to the property  and you 
agree you are responsible for it , you must be given a reasonable opportunity to fix it.  If you 
and your la ndlord agree on any steps to be taken , record this in writing.  
You should return all the keys at the final inspection. If you do not return your keys you may 
be considered to still be in pos session of the property and your landlord may claim 
compensation f or lost rent.  96 
 GETTING YOUR BOND BACK  
Note: This section discusses how to get your bond back at the end of a tenancy agreement.  
If you are a co -tenant who is leaving a tenancy agreement while your other co -tenants are 
remaining in the property , a different process for getting your bond back applies.  See the 
section on share housing for more information.  
What can the bond be used for?  
The landlord can  generally  only make deductions from the bond for : 
 Damage to the property caused by the tenant (other than ‘fair wear and tear’) . 
 Replacing keys or changing locks if the tenant fails to return all sets of keys . 
 Any rent owing – note that this only applies if the tenant moves out with rent owing. The 
tenant cannot decide to use the  bond to cover the ir final weeks of rent . 
 Any fuel (e.g. wood or gas) supplied to the property at the beginning or during the 
tenancy.  
There is no fixed rule or definition about what is ‘fair wear and tear’. Relevant considerations 
include how the damage occurred (was it thr ough normal, everyday use of the property, e.g. 
carpet faded from sunlight or marked in a high traffic area like the entrance) and the severity 
of the damage (e.g. whether a wall has scuff marks or a hole in it).  
If you and your landlord cannot agree on w hether something is fair wear and tear, or damage 
requiring repairs that can be deducted from your bond, you may wish to seek legal advice  
about your position.  
How do I get my bond back?  
To get your bond back, a bond refund  application needs to be made to the ACT  Revenue 
Office. Either you or the landlord, or both of you jointly, can make this application. This is 
usually done after the tenancy ends. The exact procedure depends on who is making the 
application and whether there is any dispute about the bond.   
Under the Act, once y our tenancy ends, the landlord must give you a bond release 
application form signed by them . The ACT Revenue Office also allows your landlord to 
request  the refund online . You will be notified by email or phone if the landlord is claiming all 
or part of yo ur bond , so it is important for you to keep your contact details up to date with 
Rental Bonds. You can submit your contact details on the website under Rental Bonds 
Form s. 
Note : If the landlord wants to make a claim against your bond, they must state the reasons 
for the claim and the estimated cost of the repair or restoration .  They cannot just state 
a total amount for the claim without explaining the reason.  
 If the landlord proposes to refund the full amount of the bond , they must give you 
the application form within 3 working days  after your tenancy ends.  
 If the landlord proposes to make a claim on the bond  (make deductions from the 
bond), the form must include the details of the reasons for the deduction/s and the 97 
 estimated costs of repairs. In this case, the landlord must give you the application form 
within 10 working days after your tenancy ends. This additiona l time allows the landlord 
to obtain quotes as necessary to inform their claim on the bond.  
 If you agree with your landlord’s proposed approach to the bond , you (and any 
other tenants) may sign the application form.  Make sure anyone who was named as a 
tenant when the bond was lodged at the beginning of your tenancy signs the form.  
 Either you or the landlord can give the signed form to the ACT Revenue Office. 
Landlords must lodge bond refund applications through the online Rental Bonds Portal.  
 The ACT  Revenu e Office will deposit the bond refund payable  to you  in accordance with 
the form  into your nominated  bank  account  (and pay out any amount owing to your 
landlord, if there are any deductions) .  
If you do not agree with your landlord’s proposed approach to t he bond, do not sign 
the bond application form given to you.  
You can lodge your own bond refund form with the ACT Revenue Office. The ACT Revenue 
Office will notify any tenants who have not signed the form and the landlord of your proposed 
approach to the bond. If one of these parties notifies the ACT Revenue Office within 14 days 
that they dispute the proposed refund, the ACT Revenue Office will refer the dispute to 
ACAT.  
Your landlord can also proceed to request the bond refund from the ACT Revenue Of fice. 
The ACT  Revenue Office will notify you of the landlord’s proposed approach to the bond. 
You will be given 14 days to respond to inform the ACT Revenue Office if you wish to 
dispute the bond refund . If you dispute the refund, the ACT Revenue Office wi ll refer the 
dispute to ACAT. ACAT will contact you to resolve the dispute.  
You can find information about the bond refund process on the ACT Revenue Office website: 
https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/r ental -bonds .  
What happens if my landlord does not give me a signed bond app lication form 
to fill in?  
If your landlord does not give you a signed bond application form within the timeframes 
required,  you can go ahead and  make an application to the ACT Revenue Office to 
refund your bond  without waiting for your landlord or agent to give you a form.  The 
ACT Revenue Office can receive and process the application without the consent of your 
landlord.   
The ACT Revenue Office will notify any tenants who have not signed the form and the 
landlord of your proposed approach to the bond. If one of these parties n otifies the 
ACT Revenue Office within 14 days that they dispute the proposed refund, the ACT 
Revenue Office will refer the dispute to ACAT.  
How is the bond refund distributed when there is more than one tenant?  
If more than one tenant was named as a party to the bond when it was lodged at the 
beginning of the tenancy, the ACT Revenue Office will assume that the bond (or that part of 
the bond) owing to the tenants is to be distributed in equal shares.  98 
 If the tenants want the bond to be paid out other than i n equal shares, they must advise the 
ACT Revenue Office. A signed statement and signed photo identification from all of the 
tenants will be required before the bond can be paid out in unequal shares.  
Tip: make sure your contact details are up -to-date with ACT Revenue  
If the contact details you provided to the ACT Revenue Office (e.g. your name or your email 
address) have changed since the start of your tenancy, make sure you advise the 
ACT Revenue Office as soon as possible.  
If the ACT Revenue Office canno t contact you because your details are out of date, this may 
delay the refund of your bond or potentially even result in deductions from the bond being 
paid out to the landlord because you did not dispute their application.  
If there has been a change of co -tenants during the tenancy agreement it is particularly 
important to ensure that the ACT Revenue Office has the correct contact details for the 
tenants who are part of the tenancy agreement when the agreement ends.  
What happens if the names of the tenants  on the tenancy agreement don’t 
match the names listed with the ACT Revenue Office?  
If at the end of the tenancy agreeement there is a discrepancy between the tenants on the 
tenancy agreement and the names listed with the ACT Revenue Office, then the ACT 
Revenue Office can refer the matter to ACAT.  ACAT will then decide who the bond should 
be released to.  
UTILITIES AND MAIL  
It is your responsibility to  arrange to get any utilities that are connected in your name 
(e.g. gas, electricity) disconnected by the date on which you will move out of the property. 
You will be responsible for paying those bills.  
If there are any metered services  to the property tha t are in the landlord’s name (e.g. water),  
the landlord must arrange to get a final meter reading by the day after you move out of the 
property. If the landlord does not get the meter reading done by that date, the landlord is 
responsible for paying the bi ll since the date of the last reading.  
You should also update your mailing address with any organisations that send you mail. You 
may wish to consider paying for a mail redirection through Australia Post for a period of time.  
GOODS LEFT IN THE PROPERTY  
You are responsible for removing all your goods from the property when you move out.  
If you accidentally leave any goods behind in the property, and you want to collect them, 
contact your landlord or agent as soon as possible.  
Under ACT law, goods left behin d in a rental property become ‘uncollected goods’. There are 
procedures a landlord must follow under the Uncollected Goods Act 1996  to dispose of or 
sell the good s. More information about uncollected goods is available from the Access 
Canberra website: https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/ .  99 
 Be aware that if you leave goods beh ind you may be charged for the cost of their storage 
and disposal.  
Landlords may wish to seek legal advice before disposing of or selling any goods left behind 
in a rental property by a former  tenant , especially if the goods are of value.  
DISPUTES: GOING TO ACAT  
ACAT  is a Tribunal – an independent body which decides disputes  and makes other 
decisions  based on the law. ACAT aims to resolve matters in a quick, informal  and 
inexpensive way.  
If you are in a dispute with your landlord , agent or the owner s coporation in a unit titled 
property and you cannot reach an agreement to resolve it, you may wish to take the dispute 
to ACAT. Co-tenants who have a dispute between themselves (related to their tenancy 
agreement) can also take the dispute to ACAT.  See the section on share housing  for more 
information.  
As well as resolving disputes, A CAT also makes other decisions about tenancies. 
In particular, it decides applications from tenants and landlords for endorsement of 
inconsistet terms  in their residential tenancy agreements .  
This section answers some basic questions about ACAT. You can find more information on 
ACAT’s website at: https://www.acat.act.gov.au/ . You can contact ACAT on (02) 6207 1740 
or tribunal@act.gov.au .   
Who can make an application  to ACAT ? 
Both t enants and landlords can make applications to ACAT. Tenants can apply to ACAT to 
resolve a dispute between them and their landlord or to resolve a dispute between co -
tenants.  
Is there a fee?  
An application fee will usually apply, although in some circumstances applicants may be 
exempt from fees or fees may be waived due to  financial hardship.  
Do I need a lawyer?  
You do not need a lawyer to represent you in ACAT. However, it can be beneficial for you to 
seek legal advice before going to ACAT, or at an early stage of your matter being before 
ACAT. This can help you understand how ACAT might decide your matter based on the law 
and what informat ion is most relevant for you to provide to ACAT.  
Note that ACAT cannot give you legal advice about your dispute, but its members and staff 
can provide information about its processes. For some options for legal advice providers, 
see the ‘Need More Help?’  section below.  
How does the ACAT process work?  
ACAT has different processes depending on the type o f residential te nancy dispute.  100 
 Applications to end a tenancy  are usually  scheduled for  hearing within two weeks.  
For other types of residential tenancy disp utes, ACAT may require tenants and landlords to 
attend a mediation or ‘preliminary conference ’ as the first step, so the parties can try to 
resolve their dispute by agreement in a facilitated professional environment.  Many matters 
can be resolved at this stage.  
If the parties cannot reach an agreement, ACAT will hold a hearing about the dispute. Th e 
parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and to explain their positions.  
ACAT will then make a decision based on the law – meaning ACAT will apply the rules in the 
Act to your case. Previous decisions of ACAT may provide some guidance on ho w ACAT 
might decide your case. You can find published decisions of  ACAT  on the ACAT website or 
in an online searchable database on the  Australasian Legal Information Institute website at: 
https://www.austlii.edu.au /. 
ACAT has flexible powers to make a wide range of orders to resolve tenancy disputes fairly 
and appropriately. Some e xamples include orders that:  
 endorse additional terms in a lease that are inconsistent with the Stand ard Terms, if both 
the tenant and landlord agree  
 determine how a bond is to be refunded if the tenant and landlord are in dispute about 
damage to the property at the end of a lease  
 allow a landlord access to inspect a property  
 require a tenant to pay outstanding rent  
 require compensation to be paid to a tenant or landlord if the other party has breached 
the Act  
 allow a landlord to refuse consent to a tenant keeping a pet or making a special 
modification to the property  
 require the landlord or tenant t o act in accordance with the terms of the tenancy 
agreement ( a performance order ), for example, this could include orders such as:  
❖ an order that the landlord undertake repairs or that the landlord ensures that the 
property complies with minimum housing sta ndards  
❖ an order that the landlord not interfere with the tena nt’s quiet use and enjoyment 
of the premises  
❖ an order that the tenant not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of their neighbours  
 terminate s (or ends)  a residential tenancy agreement, or  
 (if neces sary) issue a warrant for the tenant’s eviction.  
Tenants and landlords are  legally  required  to comply with ACAT’s orders. In some 
circumstances, failure to comply with an ACAT order (such as a payment order or 
performance order) may be grounds of terminati ng the tenancy.  Non-compliance may also 
result in ACAT imposing a penalty of up to 50 penalty units (currently, $8,000 for individuals 
or $40,500 for corporations ). Further contraventions of ACAT orders may be criminal 
offences and attract higher penalties.  101 
 RESIDENTIAL TENANCY DATABASES  
A Residential Tenancy Database is a commercially owned database which contains 
information about people who have been tenants and who have breached their agreements. 
These are sometimes called tenancy ‘black lists ’. The information has been supplied by real 
estate agents and landlords.  
Many tenants  may worry  that they will be placed on a tenancy database if they attempt to 
assert their rights during the course of their tenancy agreement.  However, this is not 
allow ed.  Under ACT law, a listing can only be made about a tenant in a database:  
 after a tenancy agreement ends (not during the agreement), and  
 if the tenant has committed a serious breach  of the agreement.  
A serious breach of the agreement means  ONLY  that:  
 the tenant owed the landlord more money than the bond at the end of the lease (e.g.  for 
significant outstanding rent or damage), or  
 ACAT or a court made an order terminating the residential tenancy agreement because 
of the breach.  
The information l isted must be accurate and up -to-date and relate only to the breach. 
Listings must be removed after 3 years.  
The agent, landlord or database operator must tell the tenant about the listing at the time 
it is proposed , and give the tenant opportunity to obj ect to the listing in whole or in part.  
Some agents and landlords check tenancy databases before entering into a residential 
tenancy agreement with a prospective tenant. Landlords and agents must notify 
prospective tenants  if their usual practice is to use  tenancy databases (and if so, which 
databases and how the prospective tenant can obtain information from the database).  
Landlords and agents must inform a prospective tenant if a search of a database 
reveals information about them.  The prospective tenant  must be told: the name of the 
database, the name of the person who listed the information, and how the prospective tenant 
can have the listing removed or amended.  
If you believe that information about you has been , or will be , listed in a tenancy databas e 
other than in accordance with the law, you may apply to ACAT for an order to prohibit, 
remove or amend a listing and for compensation.  
The collection and use of information in tenancy databases is also governed by privacy laws.  
  102 
 PENALTIES  
Tenants and landlords should be aware that the Act includes serious penalties for 
non-compliance with its rules. For example:  
 There are several offences associat ed with advertising a rental property.  These include 
publishing an advertis ement for a rental property that:  
❖ does not contain a rental rate (e.g., the weekly rent) for the property  
❖ does not contain the energy efficiency rating for the property (if one exi sts) or a 
statement that the proper ty does not have an energy efficiency rating;  
❖ include s false or misleading statements about the energy efficiency rating of a 
rental property   
❖ does not contain any non-standard tenancy terms that have been endorsed by 
ACAT (if applicable)  
❖ does not indicate that the lessor’s consent is required to keep a pet (if the lessor 
wants to impose this requirement)*  or does not indicate if the landlord has 
obtained prior approval from ACAT to impose on condition on their consent to the 
tenant keeping a pet 
❖ does not contain a statement that the premises are an adaptable housing 
dwelling (if applicable)  
❖ does not contain a statement about whether the premises comply with minimum 
housing standards or, if an exemption applies, a statement that the premises are 
exempt from compliance  
❖ include s false or misleading statements about the property’s compliance with  a 
minimum housing standard . 
Each of these  offence s carry a maximum fine of $800 for individuals or $4,050  for 
corporations .  
 It is an offence for a person to solicit or invite a tenant to offer more rent than the 
advertised rental rate for the property. This offence carries a maximum fine of  $3200 for 
individuals or $16,200 for corporations . 
 It is an offence for a landlord or ag ent to fail to lodge a bond within the requir ed 
timeframe.  The offence carries a maximum fine of $320 0 for individuals or $16,200 for 
corporations . 
 Non-compliance with an ACAT order may result in ACAT imposing a penalty of up to 
$8,000 for indivduals or $4 0,500 for corporations or imprisonment for 6 months or both . 
Further contraventions of ACAT orders may be criminal offences and attract higher 
penalties.  
Know your rights and obligations and if in doubt, seek legal advice .
